It’s  also  about  finding  friendship,  about  solidarity.  \\n Final y, it’s about finding one’s place in the world — one that is worth fighting for.”  \\n —Walter Sal es, director of “The Motorcycle Diaries”  \\n “A  journey,  a  number  of  journeys.  Ernesto  Guevara  in  search  of  adventure,  Ernesto  Guevara  in search of America, Ernesto Guevara in search of Che. On this journey of journeys, solitude found solidarity, ‘I’ turned into ‘we’.” —Eduardo Galeano \\n “Che was 24: the world was not only an oyster, it lay at his feet. And life stretched out endlessly, languidly before him… This new edition of the book, published to coincide with the release of a film by Robert Redford and Walter Sal es, is enhanced from the original 1993 publication. Included are Aleida’s much expanded comments and 24 pages of previously unpublished photos taken by Che and his traveling companion on their journey.” —  January Magazine \\n “ Das Kapital  meets   Easy Rider .” —  Times \\n “A Latin American James Dean or Jack Kerouac.”   —Washington Post \\n “An extraordinary first-person account. If the world eventual y came to know Che Guevara and his New Man, in   The Motorcycle Diaries  we see the formative man. It redoubles his image and lends a touch of humanity with enough rough edges to invite controversy.”  \\n —  Los Angeles Times Book Review \\n “For every comic escapade of the carefree roustabout there is an equal y eye-opening moment in the development of the future revolutionary leader. By the end of the journey, a politicized Guevara has emerged to predict his own legendary future.” —  Time \\n “There  is  pathos  in  these  pages  —  the  pathos  of  Che  himself,  ever  thoughtful,  ever  wil ing  to sacrifice al , burning with guilt over his own privileges and never letting his sufferings impede him.”  \\n —  New Yorker \\n “A revolutionary bestsel er… It’s true, Marxists just wanna have fun.” —  Guardian \\n “ The Motorcycle Diaries  mixes lyrical observation, youthful adventure and anti-imperialist political analysis…  This  candid  journal,  part  self-discovery,  part  fieldwork,  glimmers  with  portents  of  the future revolutionary.” —  Publishers’ Weekly \\n “What  distinguishes  these  diaries…  is  that  they  reveal  a  human  side  to  El  Che  which  historians have  successful y  managed  to  suppress.  It  is  in  the  pages  of  this  breathless  journal…  that  one senses El Che’s belief that determination and conviction can be enough to change one’s self and others… The journal… is a joy to read from start to finish.”  \\n   —Financial Times \\n “This  journey  was  obviously  the  formative  influence  on  Che’s  Pan-Americanism  and  the \\n development  of  his  revolutionary  consciousness…  There’s  political  incorrectness  galore…  this book  should  do  much  to  humanize  the  image  of  a  man  who  found  his  apotheosis  as  a  late  ‘60s cultural  icon.  It  is  also,  incidental y,  a  remarkably  good  travel  book  about  South America.”   —The   Scotsman \\n “The  vision  of  the  noble  loner,  whether  freedom-fighter  or  biker…  gives  hope  to  world-weary revolutionaries and non-revolutionaries alike.”  \\n   —Weekend Telegraph \\n “Political y correct revolutionary hero? Perhaps a few years later, but in this account Che Guevara comes over as one of the lads.”   —Bike \\n “Che  is  certainly  a  shrewd  observer  of  what  he  cal s  the  ‘strange’  human  race…  The  great  thing about this book is that Che Guevara is never a bore. It satisfies both as an enjoyable travelogue and as a chronicle of the development of one of this century’s most romantic figures.”  \\n   —Literary Review \\n “This book is worth reading for more than novelty value. In his journey across Latin America, through the  Andes  and  the  rainforest,  Che’s  diary  is  ful   of  original  observation,  hilarious  mishaps  and human understanding.” —  Briefing \\n “Che writes with wit and skil , giving insights into the world that shaped his beliefs… The reader can see him piecing together the ideas that wil  shape his political future.”   —Impact \\n \\n the motorcycle diaries \\n NOTES ON A LATIN AMERICAN JOURNEY \\n \\n \\n CHE GUEVARA PUBLISHING PROJECT \\n These books form part of a series published by Ocean Press and the Che Guevara Studies Center of Havana, with the objective of disseminating the works and ideas of Che Guevara.  \\n \\n Self-Portrait \\n A Photographic and Literary Memoir \\n The Motorcycle Diaries \\n Notes on a Latin American Journey \\n Reminiscences of the Cuban Revolutionary War \\n Authorized Edition \\n The Bolivian Diary \\n Authorized Edition \\n Che Guevara Reader \\n Writings on Politics and Revolution \\n Latin America \\n Awakening of a Continent \\n Global Justice \\n Liberation and Socialism \\n Guerrilla Warfare \\n Authorized Edition \\n Our America and Theirs \\n Kennedy and the Al iance for Progress— \\n The Debate at Punta del Este \\n Marx & Engels \\n A Biographical Introduction \\n Critical Notes On Political Economy \\n A Critical Analysis of the Soviet Economic System \\n Socialism and Humanity in Cuba \\n A Classic Edition \\n \\n \\n   ERNES TO \\n CHE GUEVARA \\n \\n the motorcycle diaries \\n NOTES ON A LATIN AMERICAN JOURNEY \\n \\n preface by Aleida Guevara March \\n introduction by Cintio Vitier \\n \\n \\n Ocean Press \\n www.oceanbooks.com.au \\n \\n \\n \\n Cover design by Karen Oh \\n Copyright © 2003 Ocean Press \\n Copyright © 2003 Che Guevara Studies Center \\n Copyright © 2003 Aleida March \\n All photographs © 2003 Che Guevara Studies Center \\n Preface © 2003 Aleida Guevara March \\n All rights reserved.

I was much younger then and I identified immediately with this man who had narrated his adventures in such a spontaneous way. Of course, as I continued reading, I began to see more clearly who this person was and I was very glad to be his daughter.  \\n It is not my aim to tel  you anything of what you wil  discover as you read, but I do not doubt that when you have finished the book you wil  want to go back to enjoy some passages again, either for the beauty they describe or the intensity of the feelings they convey.  \\n There were moments when I literal y took over Granado’s place on the motorbike and clung to my dad’s back, journeying with him over the mountains and around the lakes. I admit there were some occasions when I left him to himself, especial y at those times when he writes so graphical y things I would never talk about myself. When he does, however, he reveals yet again just how honest and unconventional he could be.  \\n To tel  you the truth, I should say that the more I read, the more in love I was with the boy my father had been. I do not know if you wil  share these sentiments with me, but while I was reading, I got to know the young Ernesto better: the Ernesto who left Argentina with his yearning for adventure and his dreams of the great deeds he would perform, and the young man who, as he discovered the reality of our continent, continued to mature as a human being and to develop as a social being.  \\n Slowly  we  see  how  his  dreams  and  ambitions  changed.  He  grew  increasingly  aware  of  the pain of many others and he al owed it to become a part of himself.  \\n The  young  man,  who  makes  us  smile  at  the  beginning  with  his  absurdities  and  craziness, becomes before our eyes increasingly sensitive as he tel s us about the complex indigenous world of Latin America, the poverty of its people and the exploitation to which they are submitted. In spite of it al , he never loses his sense of humor, which instead becomes finer and more subtle.  \\n My father,   “ése, el que fue”   (“myself, the man I used to be”), shows us a Latin America that few of us know about, describing its landscapes with words that color each image and reach into our senses, so that we too can see the things his eyes took in.  \\n His prose is fresh. His words al ow us to hear sounds we have never heard before, infusing us with the surroundings that struck this romantic being with their beauty and their crudity, yet he never \\n loses his tenderness even as he becomes firmer in his revolutionary longing. His awareness grows that what poor people need is not so much his scientific knowledge as a physician, but rather his strength and persistence in trying to bring about the social change that would enable them to live with the dignity that had been taken from them and trampled on for centuries.  \\n This young adventurer with his thirst for knowledge and his great capacity to love shows us how reality, if properly interpreted, can permeate a human being to the point of changing his or her way of thinking.  \\n Read  these  notes  of  his  that  were  written  with  so  much  love,  eloquence  and  sincerity,  these notes that more than anything else make me feel closer to my father. I hope you enjoy them and that you can join him on his journey.  \\n If you ever have the opportunity to fol ow his footsteps in reality, you wil  discover with sadness that many things remain unchanged or are even worse, and this is a chal enge for those of us who \\n —  like  this  young  man  who  years  later  would  become  Che  —  are  sensitive  to  the  reality  that  so mistreats the most wretched among us, those of us who have a commitment to helping create a world that is much more just.  \\n I  shal   leave  you  now  with  the  man  I  knew,  the  man  I  love  intensely  for  the  strength  and tenderness he demonstrated in the way he lived.  \\n Enjoy your reading! Ever onward!  \\n   Aleida Guevara March \\n   July 2003 \\n preface to the first edition \\n \\n Ernesto  Guevara’s  travel  diaries,  transcribed  by  Che’s  Personal Archive  in  Havana,*  recount  the trials, vicissitudes and tremendous adventure of a young man’s journey of discovery through Latin America. Ernesto began writing these diaries when, in December 1951, he set off with his friend Alberto Granado on their long-awaited trip from Buenos Aires, down the Atlantic coast of Argentina, across  the   pampas ,  through  the  Andes  and  into  Chile,  and  from  Chile  northward  to  Peru  and Colombia and final y to Caracas.  \\n These experiences were later rewritten by Ernesto himself in narrative form, offering the reader a  deeper  insight  into  Che’s  life,  especial y  at  a  little  known  stage,  and  revealing  details  of  his personality, his cultural background and his narrative skil  — the genesis of a style which develops in his later works. The reader can also witness the extraordinary change which takes place in him as he discovers Latin America, gets right to its very heart and develops a growing sense of a Latin American identity, ultimately making him a precursor of the new history of America.  \\n   Aleida March \\n   Che’s Personal Archive \\n   Havana, Cuba, 1993 \\n *Now the Che Guevara Studies Center of Havana, Cuba.  \\n biography of ernesto che guevara \\n \\n One of   Time  magazine’s “icons of the century,” Ernesto Guevara de la Serna was born in Rosario, Argentina, on June 14, 1928. He made several trips around Latin America during and immediately after  his  studies  at  medical  school  in  Buenos  Aires,  including  his  1952  journey  with  Alberto Granado, on the unreliable Norton motorbike La Poderosa I  described in this travel diary.  \\n He was already becoming involved in political activity and living in Guatemala when, in 1954, the  democratical y  elected  govern-ment  of  Jacobo  Árbenz  was  overthrown  in  the  CIA-organized military operation. Ernesto escaped to Mexico, profoundly radicalized.  \\n Fol owing up on a contact made in Guatemala, Guevara sought out a group of exiled Cuban revolutionaries  in  Mexico  City.  In  July  1955,  he  met  Fidel  Castro  and  immediately  enlisted  in  the Cuban  guerril a  expedition  to  overthrow  the  dictator  Fulgencio  Batista.  The  Cubans  nicknamed Ernesto “Che,” a popular form of address in Argentina.  \\n On November 25, 1956, Guevara set sail for Cuba aboard the yacht   Granma  as the doctor to the guerril a group that began the revolutionary armed struggle in Cuba’s Sierra Maestra mountains.  \\n Within  several  months,  he  had  become  the  first  Rebel  Army  commander,  though  he  continued treating wounded guerril a fighters and captured soldiers from Batista’s army.  \\n In September 1958, Guevara played a decisive role in the military defeat of Batista after he and Camilo Cienfuegos led separate guerril a columns westward from the Sierra Maestra.  \\n After Batista fled on January 1, 1959, Guevara became a key leader of the new revolutionary government, first as head of the Department of Industry of the National Institute of Agrarian Reform, then as president of the National Bank. In February 1961 he became minister of industry. He was also  a  central  leader  of  the  political  organization  that  in  1965  became  the  Communist  Party  of Cuba.  \\n Apart  from  these  responsibilities,  Guevara  represented  the  Cuban  revolutionary  government around  the  world,  heading  several  delegations  and  speaking  at  the  United  Nations  and  other international  forums  in Asia, Africa,  Latin America  and  the  socialist  bloc  countries.  He  earned  a reputation as a passionate and articulate spokesperson for Third World peoples, most famously at the  Organization  of American  States  (OAS)  conference  at  Punta  del  Este  in  Uruguay,  where  he denounced U.S. President Kennedy’s Al iance for Progress.  \\n As had been his intention since joining the Cuban revolutionary movement, Guevara left Cuba in April 1965, initial y to lead a guerril a mission to support the revolutionary struggle in the Congo.  \\n He  returned  to  Cuba  secretly  in  December  1965,  to  prepare  another  guerril a  force  for  Bolivia.  \\n Arriving  in  Bolivia  in  November  1966,  Guevara’s  plan  was  to  chal enge  that  country’s  military \\n dictatorship  and  eventual y  instigate  a  revolutionary  movement  that  would  extend  throughout  the continent  of  Latin  America.  He  was  wounded  and  captured  by  U.S.-trained-and-run  Bolivian counter-insurgency troops on October 8, 1967. The fol owing day he was murdered and his body hidden.  \\n Che Guevara’s remains were final y discovered in 1997 and returned to Cuba. A memorial was built  at  Santa  Clara  in  central  Cuba,  where  he  had  won  a  major  military  battle  during  the  Cuban revolutionary war.  \\n brief chronology of ernesto che guevara \\n \\n 1928 \\n Ernesto  Guevara  is  born  on  June  14  in  Rosario, Argentina.  He  is  the  first  child  of  middle-class parents Ernesto Guevara Lynch and Celia de la Serna.  \\n 1932 \\n The Guevara family moves from Buenos Aires to Alta Gracia, a spa town near Córdoba, on account of Ernesto’s chronic asthma. His asthma also prevents him from regular attendance at school until he is nine years old.  \\n 1948 \\n Altering his initial plan to study engineering, Ernesto enrol s in medical school at the University of Buenos Aires, while holding a series of part-time jobs, including in an al ergy treatment clinic.  \\n 1950 \\n Ernesto sets out on a 4,500 kilometer trip around the north of Argentina on a motorized bicycle.  \\n 1951–52 \\n In  October  1951,  Ernesto  and  his  friend  Alberto  Granado  decide  on  a  plan  to  ride  Alberto’s motorbike (La Poderosa I  — The Mighty One) to North America. Granado is a biochemist who had specialized in leprology and whose younger brothers had been Ernesto’s school friends. They leave Córdoba in December, heading first to farewel  Ernesto’s family in Buenos Aires. The adventures experienced  on  this  trip,  written  up  by  Ernesto  during  and  after  the  journey,  comprise  this  book, published first as   Notas de Viaje  (  Travel Notes  or   The Motorcycle Diaries ).  \\n 1953 \\n Ernesto graduates as a doctor and almost immediately embarks on another journey around Latin America  which  takes  in  Bolivia,  Peru,  Ecuador,  Panama,  Costa  Rica  and  Guatemala,  where  he meets Antonio (Ñico) López, a young Cuban revolutionary. In Bolivia, he is witness to the Bolivian Revolution. The account of these travels was first published as   Otra Vez  (in English,   Latin America   Diaries ).  \\n 1954 \\n Ernesto’s political views are profoundly radicalized when in Guatemala he sees the overthrow of the democratical y  elected  government  of  Jacobo  árbenz  by  U.S.-backed  forces.  He  escapes  to Mexico where he contacts the group of Cuban revolutionary exiles. In Mexico, he marries Peruvian Hilda Gadea, with whom he has a daughter, Hildita.  \\n 1955 \\n After  meeting  Fidel  Castro,  he  agrees  to  join  the  group  being  organized  to  wage  guerril a  war against  the  Batista  dictatorship.  Now  cal ed  “Che”  by  the  Cubans  —  a  common  nickname  for Argentines — in November 1956 he sails as the troop’s doctor on the yacht   Granma .  \\n 1956–58 \\n Che soon demonstrates outstanding military ability and is promoted to the rank of commander in July 1957. In December 1958, he leads the Rebel Army to a decisive victory over Batista’s forces at Santa Clara in central Cuba.  \\n 1959 \\n In  February,  Che  is  declared  a  Cuban  citizen  in  recognition  of  his  contribution  to  the  island’s liberation. He marries Aleida March, with whom he has four children. In October, he is appointed head  of  the  Industrial  Department  of  the  Institute  of Agrarian  Reform  and  in  November  becomes President  of  the  National  Bank  of  Cuba.  With  a  gesture  of  disdain  for  money,  he  signs  the  new banknotes simply as “Che.”  \\n 1960 \\n Representing the revolutionary government, Che undertakes an extensive trip to the Soviet Union, the  German  Democratic  Republic,  Czechoslovakia,  China  and  North  Korea,  signing  several  key trade agreements.  \\n 1961 \\n Che  is  appointed  head  of  the  newly  established  Ministry  of  Industry.  In August,  he  heads  Cuba’s delegation  to  the  Organization  of American  States  (OAS)  at  Punta  del  Este,  Uruguay,  where  he denounces U.S. President Kennedy’s Al iance for Progress.  \\n 1962 \\n A  fusion  of  Cuban  revolutionary  organizations  takes  place  and  Che  is  elected  to  the  National Directorate. Che visits the Soviet Union for the second time.  \\n 1963 \\n Che  travels  to Algeria,  which  has  just  won  independence  from  France  under  the  government  of Ahmed Ben Bel a.  \\n 1964 \\n Before heading off for an extensive trip around Africa, Che addresses the UN General Assembly in December.  \\n 1965 \\n Che  leads  an  international  mission  to  the  Congo  to  support  the  liberation  movement  founded  by \\n Patrice  Lumumba.  Responding  to  mounting  speculation  about  Che’s  whereabouts,  Fidel  Castro reads Che’s farewel  letter to the Central Committee of the newly founded Cuban Communist Party.  \\n In December, Che returns to Cuba to prepare in secret for a new mission to Bolivia.  \\n 1966 \\n In November, Che arrives in Bolivia in disguise.  \\n 1967 \\n In April, Che’s “Message to the Tricontinental” is published, cal ing for the creation of “two, three, many Vietnams.” The same month, part of his guerril a group becomes separated from the main detachment.  On  October  8,  the  remaining  17  guerril as  are  ambushed  and  Che  is  wounded  and captured.  The  fol owing  day  he  is  murdered  by  Bolivian  forces  acting  under  instructions  from Washington. His remains are buried in an unmarked grave along with the bodies of several other guerril a fighters.  October 8  is designated the Day of the Heroic Guerril a in Cuba.  \\n 1997 \\n Che’s  remains  are  final y  located  in  Bolivia  and  returned  to  Cuba,  where  they  are  placed  in  a memorial at Santa Clara.  \\n \\n map of the motorcycle diaries \\n \\n \\n itinerary of the motorcycle diaries \\n \\n ARGENTINA \\n 1951 \\n \\n December \\n Córdoba to Buenos Aires \\n 1952 \\n \\n January 4 \\n Leave Buenos Aires \\n January 6 \\n Vil a Gesel \\n January 13 \\n Miramar \\n January 14 \\n Necochea \\n January 16–21 \\n Bahía Blanca \\n January 22 \\n En route to Choele Choel \\n January 25 \\n Choele Choel \\n January 29 \\n Piedra del Águila \\n January 31 \\n San Martín de los Andes \\n February 8 \\n Nahuel Huapí \\n February 11 \\n San Carlos de Bariloche \\n \\n CHILE \\n February 14 Take the   Modesta Victoria  to Peul a \\n February 18 \\n Temuco \\n February 21 \\n Lautaro \\n February 27 \\n Los Ángeles \\n March 1 \\n Santiago de Chile \\n March 7 \\n Valparaíso \\n March 8–10 \\n Aboard the   San Antonio \\n March 11 \\n Antofagasta \\n March 12 \\n Baquedano \\n March 13–15 \\n Chuquicamata \\n March 20 \\n Iquique (and the Toco, La Rica Aventura and Prosperidad Nitrate Companies) March 22 \\n Arica \\n \\n PERU \\n March 24 \\n Tacna \\n March 25 \\n Tarata \\n March 26 \\n Puno \\n March 27 \\n Sail on Lake Titicaca \\n March 28 \\n Juliaca \\n March 30 \\n Sicuani \\n March 31 – April 3 Cuzco \\n April 4–5 \\n Machu Picchu \\n April 6–7 \\n Cuzco \\n April 11 \\n Abancay \\n April 13 \\n Huancarama \\n April 14 \\n Huambo \\n April 15 \\n Huancarama \\n April 16–19 \\n Andahuaylas \\n April 22–24 \\n Ayacucho to Huancal o \\n April 25–26 \\n La Merced \\n April 27 \\n Between Oxapampa and San Ramón \\n April 28 \\n San Ramón \\n April 30 \\n Tarma \\n May 1–17 \\n Lima \\n May 19 \\n Cerro de Pasco \\n May 24 \\n Pucal pa \\n May 25–31 \\n Aboard   La Cenepa  sailing down Río Ucayali, a tributary of the Amazon June 1–5 \\n Iquitos \\n June 6–7 \\n Aboard   El Cisne  sailing to the leper colony of San Pablo June 8–20 \\n San Pablo \\n June 21 \\n Aboard the   Mambo-Tango  raft on the Amazon \\n \\n COLOMBIA \\n June 23 – July 1      Leticia \\n July 2 \\n Leave Leticia by plane \\n July 2–10 \\n Bogotá \\n July 12–13 \\n Cúcuta \\n \\n VENEZUELA \\n July 14 \\n San Cristóbal \\n July 16 \\n Between Barquisimeto and Corona \\n July 17–26 Caracas, where Che and Alberto separate \\n \\n UNITED STATES \\n Late July Miami \\n \\n ARGENTINA \\n August Che returns to his family in Córdoba \\n \\n CINTIO VITIER \\n introduction \\n \\n If there is one hero in Latin America’s struggle for liberation — stretching from Bolívar’s1 time until our own — who has attracted young people from Latin America and from al  over the world, that hero is Ernesto Che Guevara. And though since his death he has become a modern myth, he has not  yet  been  stripped  of  his  youthful  vitality.  To  the  contrary,  his  mythic  status  has  only  served  to heighten his youthfulness which, together with his daring and his purity, seem to constitute the secret essence of his charisma.  \\n Becoming a myth, a symbol of so many scattered and fiercely held hopes, presupposes that such a character possesses a kind of gravity, a certain solemnity. It is good that this is so; historic utopia needs faces to embody it. But we shouldn’t lose sight of the everyday nature of those human beings, who were children, teenagers and young people before they acquired the skil s by which to guide us. It is not that I want to bury their exceptional natures in the common or familiar aspects of their lives, but that knowledge of those first, formative stages shows us the starting point for their later trajectories.  \\n This is especial y true in Che’s case, whose account of this first trip he made with his friend Alberto Granado offers the young at heart such a close and cheerful, serious and at the same time ironic  image  of  the  young  man,  that  we  can  almost  glimpse  his  smile  and  hear  his  voice  and asthmatic wheeze. He is young, like them, and he fil ed his whole life with youthfulness and matured his youth without diluting it.  \\n This edition of   The Motorcycle Diaries , the notes describing a journey made without hesitation, aboard the noisy motorcycle La Poderosa I  (which gave out halfway, but only after transmitting to the adventure a joyous impulse we, too, receive), free as the wind, with the sole purpose of getting to know the world, is dedicated to people whose youth is not merely sequential, but wholehearted and spiritual.  \\n In  the  first  pages,  the  young  man  who  would  become  one  of  the  genuine  heroes  of  the  20th century  cautions  us,  “This  is  not  a  story  of  heroic  feats.”  The  word  “heroic”  rings  out  above  the others, because we cannot read these pages without thinking of Che’s future, an image of him in the Sierra Maestra, an image which reached perfection at Quebrada del Yuro in Bolivia.2 \\n If this youthful adventure had not been prelude to his revolutionary formation, these pages would be different, and we would read them differently, though we cannot imagine how. Simply knowing \\n that they are Che’s — though he wrote them before becoming Che — makes us believe that he had a presentiment regarding the way they should be read. For example: The person who wrote these notes passed away the moment his feet touched Argentine soil again. The person who reorganizes and polishes them, me, is no longer, at least I’m not the person I once was. All this wandering around “Our America with a capital A” has changed me more than I thought.  \\n These pages are a testimony — a photographic negative, as he also put it — of an experience that changed him, a first “departure” toward the outer world which, like his final departure, was Quixotic in  its  semi-unconscious  style  and,  as  for  Quixote,  had  the  same  effect  on  the  scope  of  his consciousness. This was the “spirit of a dreamer” experiencing an awakening.  \\n In principle, and with the perfect logic of the unforeseeable, their journey was at first directed toward  North America,  as  in  fact  it  turned  out  to  be:  toward  the  “photographic  negative”  of  North America  that  is  South  American  poverty  and  helplessness,  and  toward  real  knowledge  of  what North America means for us.  \\n “The enormity of our endeavor escaped us in those moments; al  we could see was the dust on the road ahead and ourselves on the bike, devouring kilometers in our flight northward.” Wasn’t that \\n “dust on the road,” though without Che realizing it, real y the same dust José Martí3 saw when he traveled from La Guaira to Caracas “in a common little coach”? Wasn’t it the Quixotic dust in which the  ghosts  of American  redemption  appeared,  “the  natural  cloud  of  dust  that  must  rise  when  our terrible casing of chains fal s to the ground”?4 But Martí was coming from the north, and Che was traveling toward himself, catching only glimpses of his destiny, which we glimpse as wel  through his anecdotes and vignettes.  \\n Comeback,  the  little  dog  with  “aviator’s  impulses”  Che  presents  to  us  so  comical y,  leaping around  the  motorcycle  from  Vil a  Gesel   to  Miramar,  reappears  years  later  in  the  Sierra  Maestra mountains  as  a  puppy  who  must  be  strangled,  because  of  its  “hysterical  howls”  during  an unsuccessful  ambush  laid  in  the  hope  of  catching  [Batista’s  notorious  army  colonel]  Sánchez Mosquera. “With one last nervous twitch, the puppy stopped moving. There it lay, sprawled out, its little  head  spread  over  the  twigs.”5  But,  at  the  end  of  this  incident  from   Episodes  of  the   Revolutionary War , another dog appears lying in the hamlet of Mar Verde: Félix patted its head, and the dog looked at him. Félix returned the glance, and then he and I exchanged a guilty look.  \\n Suddenly everyone fell silent. An imperceptible stirring came over us, as the dog’s meek yet roguish gaze seemed to contain  a  hint  of  reproach.  There,  in  our  presence,  though  observing  us  through  the  eyes  of  another  dog,  was  the murdered puppy.  \\n It  was  Comeback  who  had  returned,  living  up  to  his  name,  reminding  us  also  of  what  Ezequiel Martínez Estrada, our other great Argentine, said about José Martí’s campaign diary: These  emotions,  these  sensations,  cannot  be  described  or  expressed  in  the  language  of  poets  and  painters,  \\n musicians and mystics; they must be… absorbed without reply, as animals do with their contemplative and entranced eyes.6 \\n A comparison of   Episodes   with   The Motorcycle Diaries  shows us that, even though more than 10 \\n years had passed, the latter was a literary model for the former. It contains the same moderation; the  same  candor;  the  same  nimble  freshness;  exactly  the  same  concept  of  moments  used  to provide  unity  for  each  brief  chapter;  and,  of  course,  the  same  imperturbable  steadiness  that accepts both happy and tragic events without sharp inhalation or exhalation.  \\n It  isn’t  literary  skil   but  fidelity  to  experience  and  narrative  effectiveness  that  is  sought.  When both are attained, skil  fol ows natural y, taking its al otted place, neither blinding nor disturbing but making its contribution. Here, with little fumbling or hesitation, Che’s style is already formed. The years would polish it, just as he himself polished his wil  with the pleasure of an artist, though not that of  a  wordsmith:  a  quiet  shyness  forced  him  not  to  dwel   too  much  but  to  push  on  with  the  words toward the poetry of the naked image, which his minimal touch turned into reality. His “I—it-inme”  \\n circle  opens  and  closes  continual y  without  ever  becoming  dense,  accommodating  a  style  that prefers  to  remain  hidden.  The  prose  on  the  page  sheds  light,  though  does  not  drag  on  the imperceptible  lightness  of  the  narrative.  It  flows  between  description  of  feeling  (in   Episodes ,  “the determined  murderer  left  a  trail  of  burned  huts,  of  sul en  sadness…”)  and  narrative  accounts  in which he searches for himself (in the   Diaries , “Man, the measure of al  things, speaks here through my mouth and narrates in my own language that which my eyes have seen”) and sometimes even seems to be watching us.  \\n Che’s  colorful  prose  paints  objects  as  far  as  his  eyes  can  see  and  often,  if  the  landscape permits it, with an intimate touch: \\n The road snakes between the low foothills that sound the beginning of the great cordillera of the Andes, then descends steeply until it reaches an unattractive, miserable town, surrounded in sharp contrast by magnificent, densely wooded mountains.  \\n The  episode  of  the  attempt  to  steal  wine,  and  others  in  this  cheeky  tradition,  contains  precious pearls of diction: \\n The fact was, we were as broke as ever, retracing in our minds the smiles that had greeted my drunken antics, trying to find some trace of the irony with which we could identify the thief.  \\n A sense of strangeness returns. In the chapter “Circular Exploration”: “As night fel  it brought us a thousand  strange  noises  and  the  sensation  of  walking  into  empty  space  with  each  step.”  In  Episodes : “Then, in the middle of the ambush, an eerie moment of silence arose. When we went to gather the dead after the initial shooting, there was no one on the highway…” The imagery is fairly bursting with both the abundance and the silence of the visual world: The huge figure of a stag dashed like a quick breath across the stream and his body, silver by the light of the rising moon, disappeared into the undergrowth. This tremor of nature cut straight to our hearts. (  The Motorcycle Diaries ) \\n [Fidel’s] voice and presence in the woods, lit up by the torches, took on moving tones, and you could see that our leader changed the ideas of many people. (  Episodes ) \\n Though reference is made to Fidel’s voice and tone, the scene seems silent to us, as if it has been witnessed from afar.  \\n In these travel notes, several Quixotic or Chaplinesque episodes — such as the already cited theft of the wine, the nocturnal pursuit of the two young men “by a furious swarm of dancers,” their enlistment in a corps of Chilean firefighters, the delectable escapade of the melons and their trail over the waves, and the enigma of the impossible photo in a miserable hut on a hil  near Caracas \\n — are wrapped in a similar silence.  \\n La  Poderosa’s  near  to  last  stand  is  told  with  cinematographic  effect  and  we  seem  to  be watching it al  amid a film-like silence: \\n I threw on the hand brake which, soldered ineptly, also broke. For some moments, I saw nothing more than the blurred shape of cattle flying past us on each side, while poor Poderosa gathered speed down the steep hill. By an absolute miracle we managed to graze only the leg of the last cow, but in the distance a river was screaming toward us with terrifying efficacy. I veered on to the side of the road and in the blink of an eye the bike mounted the two-meter bank, embedding us between two rocks, but we were unhurt.  \\n These youthful adventures — veined with cheerfulness, humor and frequently self-directed irony — \\n seek the spirit of the landscape rather than merely the scenery. That “spirit” was found in the sudden appearance of the deer: “We walked slowly so as not to disturb the peace of the wild sanctuary with which we were now communing.” Che writes with none of the sarcasm he dedicates to the topic of religion: “Both [of us] assistants waited for Sunday [and the roast] with a kind of religious devotion.”  \\n So  while  being  unbelievers,  they  were  able  to  feel  the  metaphorical  presence  of  a  “sanctuary”  in nature, where they were in close rapport with its “spirit” — immediately reminding us of analogous images  from  the  freethinking  Martí,  such  as  this  from  his   Simple Verses :  “The  bishop  of  Spain seeks / Supports for his shrine. / On wild mountain peaks / The poplars are mine.”7 \\n On  March  7,  1952,  in  Valparaíso,  they  came  face  to  face  with  injustice:  its  victim  was  an asthmatic old woman, a customer in a smal  shop by the name of La Gioconda: The poor thing was in a pitiful state, breathing the acrid smell of concentrated sweat and dirty feet that filled her room, mixed with the dust from a couple of armchairs, the only luxury items in her house. On top of her asthma, she had a heart condition.  \\n After completing a picture of total ruin, and further embittered by the animosity of the sick woman’s family, Che — who felt helpless as a doctor and was approaching the awakening of conscience that would trigger his other, definitive vocation — wrote these memorable words: It is there, in the final moments, for people whose farthest horizon has always been tomorrow, that one comprehends the profound tragedy circumscribing the life of the proletariat the world over. In those dying eyes there is a submissive \\n appeal for forgiveness and also, often, a desperate plea for consolation which is lost to the void, just as their body will soon be lost in the magnitude of the mystery surrounding us.  \\n Unable to continue their journey any other way, the pair decided to stow away on a ship that would take them to Antofagasta, Chile. At that moment, they — or, at least, Che — did not see things so clearly: \\n There [looking at the sea, leaning side by side on the railing of the   San Antonio ], we understood that our vocation, our true vocation, was to move for eternity along the roads and seas of the world. Always curious, looking into everything that came before our eyes, sniffing out each corner but only ever faintly — not setting down roots in any land or staying long enough to see the substratum of things; the outer limits would suffice.  \\n The sea held a greater attraction than the voyagers’ “road,” because where land demands that even those in passing take root, the sea represents absolute freedom from al  ties. “And now, I feel my great roots unearth, free, and…” The verse that heads the chapter on his liberation from Chichina says it al . Al ? Che tore up another root in the presence of the old asthmatic Chilean woman. And soon  his  chest  would  be  stung  again  when  he  made  friends  with  a  married  Chilean  couple, communist workers who had been harassed in Baquedano.  \\n The  couple,  numb  with  cold,  in  the  desert  night,  huddling  against  each  other  in  the  desert  night,  were  a  living representation of the proletariat in any part of the world.  \\n Like good sons of San Martín,8 they shared their blankets with them.  \\n It was one of the coldest times in my life, but also one which made me feel a little more brotherly toward this strange, for me at least, human species.  \\n That  strangeness,  that  deep  separation  and  intrepid  solitude  in  which  he  was  stil   wrapped,  is curious. There is nothing lonelier than adventure. Until he was fil ed with pity for the gal ey slaves and for the whipped child, Don Quixote was alone, surrounded by strangeness, by the craziness of the world around him. In his   Meditations on Quixote , José Ortega y Gasset wrote, as the center of his reflections, “I am myself and my circumstances,” which has usual y been understood as the sum or symbiosis  of  two  factors.  It  may  also  be  understood  as  a  dilemma  in  which  the  “I”  or  “myself”  \\n expresses  those  two  factors  as  separated,  distanced,  though  intensely  related.  This  dilemma appeared in Che’s memoirs of his first “departure,” when he said: Although the blurred silhouette of the couple was nearly lost in the distance separating us, we could still see the man’s singularly determined face and we remembered his straightforward invitation: “Come, comrades, let’s eat together. I, too, am a tramp,” showing his underlying disdain for the parasitic nature he saw in our aimless traveling.  \\n Whose  was  this  secret  disdain:  the  humble  worker’s  or  Che’s?  Or  perhaps  neither,  but  that  the meeting “in the desert night,” the sharing of the   mate , bread, cheese and blankets, caused a spark which lit up a painful separation.  \\n At any rate, they were in Chuquicamata, with the mine and the miner from the south: \\n Cold efficiency and impotent resentment go hand in hand in the big mine, linked in spite of the hatred by a common necessity to live, on the one hand, and to speculate on the other… \\n An imposing suggestion appeared, and the leap to a kind of idea which would achieve its context, its possible meaning, years later in Cuba: \\n …we will see whether some day, some miner will take up his pick in pleasure and go and poison his lungs with a conscious joy. They say that’s what it’s like over there, where the red blaze that now lights up the world comes from. So they say. I don’t know.  \\n In fact, in Cuba in 1964, Che would link these ideas with the words of the poet León Felipe (I don’t know if Che was familiar with them when writing the lines above): “No one has yet been able to dig to the rhythm of the sun… no one has cut an ear of corn with love and grace.”  \\n I quote these words because today we could tell that great, desperate poet to come now to Cuba; to see how human beings, after passing through all of the stages of capitalist alienation and after thinking of themselves as beasts of burden harnessed to the yoke of the exploiter, have rediscovered their path and have found their way back to play. Now, in our Cuba, work is acquiring a new meaning and is done with a new joy.9 \\n Yet  in  March  1952,  Che  simply  wrote,  “we  wil   see.”  The  harsh  lessons  continued  in  the  chapter \\n “Chuquicamata,” named after the mining town that was “like a scene from a modern drama,” and which he soberly described with a balance of impression, reflection and data. Its greatest lesson was “taught by the graveyards of the mines, containing only a smal  share of the immense number of people devoured by cave-ins, silica and the hel ish climate of the mountain.” In his note of March 22, 1952, or some time later revising his notes, Che concluded: “The biggest effort Chile should make is  to  shake  its  uncomfortable  Yankee  friend  from  its  back,  a  task  that  for  the  moment  at  least  is Herculean.” The name Salvador Al ende stops us in our tracks.  \\n On the motorcycle, on trucks or in vans, on a ship or in a little Ford; sleeping in police stations, under the stars or in occasional shelters; Che struggling almost constantly with his asthma, the two friends crossed Argentina and Chile. They entered Peru on foot. The Peruvian Indians had a huge impact on them, just as the Mexican Indians had impressed Martí: These people who watch us walk through the streets of the town are a defeated race. Their stares are tame, almost fearful, and completely indifferent to the outside world. Some give the impression they go on living only because it’s a habit they cannot shake.  \\n They come to the kingdom of defeated stone, Pachamama’s kingdom, Mother Earth, who receives the spat-out “chewed coca leaves instead of stones” with their accompanying “troubles.” The center or  navel  of  the  world,  where  Mama  Ocl o  dropped  her  golden  wedge  into  the  earth.  The  place Viracocha  chose:  Cuzco. And  there,  in  the  middle  of  the  baroque  procession  of  Our  Lord  of  the Earthquakes, “a brown Christ,” they find an eternal reminder of the north which can only be seen from South America, its fatal and denouncing antithesis: \\n Standing  over  the  small  frames  of  the  Indians  gathered  to  see  the  procession  pass,  the  blond  head  of  a  North American can occasionally be glimpsed. With his camera and sports shirt, he seems to be (and in fact, actually is) a correspondent from another world… \\n The cathedral of Cuzco brought out the artist in Che, with such observations as this: “Gold doesn’t have  the  gentle  dignity  of  silver  which  becomes  more  charming  as  it  ages,  and  so  the  cathedral seems to be decorated like an old woman with too much makeup.” Of the many churches he visited, he  was  particularly  struck  by  the  lonely,  disreputable  and  “pitiful  image  of  the  bel   towers  of  the Church of Belén, toppled by the earthquake, lying like dismembered animals on the hil side.” But his most  penetrating  judgment  of  Peruvian  colonial  baroque  is  found  in  the  lines  of  his  sharply contrasting description of Lima’s cathedral: \\n There in Lima, the art is more stylized, with an almost effeminate touch: the cathedral towers are tall and graceful, maybe the most slender of all the cathedrals in the Spanish colonies. The lavishness of the woodwork in Cuzco has been left behind and taken up here in gold. The naves are light and airy, contrasting with those dark, hostile caverns of the Inca city. The paintings are also bright, almost joyous, and of schools more recent than the hermetic mestizos, who painted their saints with a dark and captive fury.  \\n Their  visit  to  Machu  Picchu  on  April  5  served  as  the  subject  for  a  newspaper  article  that  Che published  in  Panama  on  December  12,  1953,  in  which  there  is  a  careful  gathering  of  data  and historical information, and a didactic intention that was absent from his personal notes.  \\n Something similar occurred in an article entitled “A Glance at the Banks of the Giant of Rivers,”  \\n which was also published in Panama, on November 22, 1953, though in this Che placed greater emphasis on experience, describing his journey down the Amazon on a raft. The raft, humorously christened   Mambo-Tango   —  so  they  wouldn’t  be  accused  of  being  fanatics  about  the  latter  — \\n enabled Che and Alberto, with a lot of hard work and danger, to learn about the harsh reality of the Amazonian Indians.  \\n From  the  solitary  heights  of  the  “enigmatic  stone  blocks”  to  the  debilitating  neglect  they witnessed on the banks of the Amazon, it was like traveling through a genetic map of the Americas.  \\n Celebrating his 24th birthday in the leper colony of San Pablo, Che spoke, in a style reminiscent of Bolívar and Martí: “We constitute a single mestizo race, which from Mexico to the Magel an Straits bears notable ethnographic similarities. And so, in an attempt to rid myself of the weight of smal - \\n minded provincialism, I propose a toast to Peru and to a United Latin America.”  \\n There  was  no  hint  of  solemnity  in  these  words;  rather,  pretending  his  words  were  merely rhetorical, he spoke with a confidence that placed them outside al  convention: “My oratory offering was  received  with  great  applause.”  He  did  the  same  in  a  letter  that  he  wrote  to  his  mother  from Bogotá on July 6, 1952, (included here to complete the description of his Colombian experiences), when he referred once again to his “Pan-American speech,” which won “great applause from the notable,  and  notably  drunk,  audience,”  and  when  he  commented,  with  affectionate  sarcasm,  on Granado’s own words of gratitude: “Alberto, who believes he is Perón’s natural heir, delivered such \\n an  impressive,  demagogic  speech  that  our  wel -wishers  were  convulsed  with  laughter.”  But  he spoke in a very different tone of the lepers and their lives, using moderation to try — in vain — to hide his own suffering. Writing about their departure from the San Pablo leper colony, Che said: That night an assembly of the colony’s patients gave us a farewell serenade, with lots of local songs sung by a blind man. The orchestra was made up of a flute player, a guitarist and an accordion player with almost no fingers, and a \\n “healthy”  contingent  helping  out  with  a  saxophone,  a  guitar  and  some  percussion.  After  that  came  the  time  for speeches, in which four patients spoke as well as they could, a little awkwardly. One of them froze, unable to go on, until out  of  desperation  he  shouted,  “Three  cheers  for  the  doctors!” Afterwards, Alberto  thanked  them  warmly  for  their welcome… \\n Che described the scene in detail in the letter to his mother, (“an accordion player with no fingers on his right hand used little sticks tied to his wrist” and “almost al  the others were horribly deformed, due  to  the  nervous  form  of  the  disease”),  trying  unsuccessful y  not  to  sadden  her  too  much, comparing it with a “scene from a horror movie,” but the tearing beauty of that farewel  was clear: The patients cast off and to the sound of a folk tune the human cargo drifted away from shore; the faint light of their lanterns giving the people a ghostly quality.  \\n From his notes on their experiences with the lepers, for whom they surely did much good, not only by  treating  them  but  also  by  playing  soccer  and  talking  with  them  in  the  spirit  of  unprejudiced, fraternal,  intense  humanity  —  explaining  the  lepers’  immense  gratitude  —  we  can  perceive  the origins of the budding revolutionary in Che. I emphasize these words: “If there’s anything that wil make us seriously dedicate ourselves to leprosy, it wil  be the affection shown to us by al  the sick we’ve met along the way.” Impossible to imagine at the time how serious and deep that dedication would be, understanding “leprosy” to mean al  of human misery.  \\n Having read these notes, fil ed with so many contrasts and teachings, with so much comedy and tragedy, like life itself, and having commented — not exhaustively, but only as suggestions — I conclude with the joyous image of Che arriving in Caracas, wrapped in his traveling blanket, staring around him at the Latin American panorama, “muttering al  sorts of verses, lul ed by the roar of the truck.”  \\n I’l   leave  you  with  no  further  commentary,  because,  in  its  terrible,  unadorned  majesty,  that exceptional final chapter “A Note in the Margin” neither needs nor tolerates it. In fact, I’m not sure whether  this  unfathomable  “revelation”  should  be  placed  at  the  beginning  or  the  end  of  these \\n “diaries”;  the  revelation  Che  saw  “printed  in  the  night  sky”;  his  own  fate;  waiting  for  “the  great guiding spirit to cleave humanity into two antagonistic halves”; the Great Semí who, in Martí’s view of Our America, would go “astride its condor, spreading the seed of the new America through the romantic nations of the continent and the sorrowful islands of the sea.”10 It is an inexorable chapter that, like a tragic flash of lightning, il uminates for us the “sacred space” in the depths of the soul of one who cal ed himself “this smal  soldier of the 20th century.” Of one who, in our invincible hope,  \\n always takes “to the road” again, shield on his arm and feeling “the ribs of Rocinante”11 beneath his heels.  \\n \\n \\n 1.

It is a glimpse of two lives running paral el for a time, with similar hopes and convergent dreams.  \\n In  nine  months  of  a  man’s  life  he  can  think  a  lot  of  things,  from  the  loftiest  meditations  on philosophy to the most desperate longing for a bowl of soup — in total accord with the state of his stomach. And if, at the same time, he’s somewhat of an adventurer, he might live through episodes of interest to other people and his haphazard record might read something like these notes.  \\n And so, the coin was thrown in the air, turning many times, landing sometimes heads and other times tails. Man, the measure of al  things, speaks here through my mouth and narrates in my own language that which my eyes have seen. It is likely that out of 10 possible heads I have seen only one true tail, or vice versa. In fact it’s probable, and there are no excuses, for these lips can only describe what these eyes actual y see. Is it that our whole vision was never quite complete, that it was  too  transient  or  not  always  wel -informed?  Were  we  too  uncompromising  in  our  judgments?  \\n Okay,  but  this  is  how  the  typewriter  interpreted  those  fleeting  impulses  raising  my  fingers  to  the keys, and those impulses have now died. Moreover, no one can be held responsible for them.  \\n The person who wrote these notes passed away the moment his feet touched Argentine soil again.  The  person  who  reorganizes  and  polishes  them,  me,  is  no  longer,  at  least  I  am  not  the person I once was. Al  this wandering around “Our America with a capital A” has changed me more than I thought.  \\n In  any  photographic  manual  you’l   come  across  the  strikingly  clear  image  of  a  landscape, apparently  taken  by  night,  in  the  light  of  a  ful   moon.  The  secret  behind  this  magical  vision  of \\n “darkness at noon” is usual y revealed in the accompanying text. Readers of this book wil  not be wel  versed about the sensitivity of my retina — I can hardly sense it myself. So they wil  not be able to check what is said against a photographic plate to discover at precisely what time each of my \\n “pictures” was taken. What this means is that if I present you with an image and say, for instance, that it was taken at night, you can either believe me, or not; it matters little to me, since if you don’t happen  to  know  the  scene  I’ve  “photographed”  in  my  notes,  it  wil   be  hard  for  you  to  find  an alternative to the truth I’m about to tel . But I’l  leave you now, with myself, the man I used to be… \\n \\n PRÓDROMOS \\n forewarnings \\n \\n It  was  a  morning  in  October.  Taking  advantage  of  the  holiday  on  the  17th  I  had  gone  to Córdoba.*  We  were  at  Alberto  Granado’s  place  under  the  vine,  drinking  sweet   mate *  and commenting on recent events in this “bitch of a life,” tinkering with La Poderosa I .** Alberto  was lamenting the fact that he had to quit his job at the leper colony in San Francisco del Chañar and about how poor his pay was now at the Español Hospital. I had also quit my job, but unlike Alberto I was very happy to leave. I was feeling uneasy, more than anything because having the spirit of a dreamer I was particularly jaded with medical school, hospitals and exams.  \\n Along the roads of our daydream we reached remote countries, navigated tropical seas and traveled al  through Asia. And suddenly, slipping in as if part of our fantasy, the question arose: \\n “Why don’t we go to North America?”  \\n “North America? But how?”  \\n “On La Poderosa, man.”  \\n The trip was decided just like that, and it never erred from the basic principle laid down in that moment: improvisation. Alberto’s brothers joined us in a round of   mate  as we sealed our pact never to give up until we had realized our dream. So began the monotonous business of chasing visas, certificates and documents, that is to say, of overcoming the many hurdles modern nations erect in the paths of would-be travelers. To save face, just in case, we decided to say we were going to Chile.  \\n My most important mission before leaving was to take exams in as many subjects as possible; Alberto’s to prepare the bike for the long journey, and to study and plan our route. The enormity of our endeavor escaped us in those moments; al  we could see was the dust on the road ahead and ourselves on the bike, devouring kilometers in our flight northward.  \\n *At the time a national holiday to commemorate Juan Perón’s 1945 release from prison. General Perón was president of Argentina from 1946 to 1955 and from 1973 until his death in 1974.  \\n *The Argentine national drink, a tea-like beverage made from the herb   mate .  \\n **Granado’s Norton 500 motorcycle, literally “The Mighty One.”  \\n \\n EL DESCUBRIMIENTO DEL OCÉANO \\n discovery of the ocean \\n \\n The ful  moon is silhouetted against the sea, smothering the waves with silver reflections. Sitting on a dune, we watch the continuous ebb and flow, each with our own thoughts. For me, the sea has always been a confidant, a friend absorbing al  it is told and never revealing those secrets; always giving the best advice — its meaningful noises can be interpreted any way you choose. For Alberto, it  is  a  new,  strangely  perturbing  sight,  and  the  intensity  with  which  his  eyes  fol ow  every  wave building, swel ing, then dying on the beach, reflects his amazement. Nearing 30, Alberto is seeing the Atlantic for the first time and is overwhelmed by this discovery that signifies an infinite number of paths to al  ends of the earth. The fresh wind fil s the senses with the power and mood of the sea; everything is transformed by its touch; even Comeback* gazes, his odd little nose aloft, at the silver ribbons unrol ing before him several times a minute.  \\n Comeback  is  both  a  symbol  and  a  survivor:  a  symbol  of  the  union  demanding  my  return;  a survivor of his own bad luck — two fal s from the bike (in one of which he and his bag flew off the back), his persistent diarrhoea and even getting trampled by a horse.  \\n We’re in Vil a Gesel , north of Mar del Plata, enjoying my uncle’s hospitality in his home and reliving  our  first  1,200  kilometers  —  apparently  the  easiest,  though  they’ve  already  given  us  a healthy respect for distances. We have no idea whether or not we’l  get there, but we do know the going  wil   be  hard  —  at  least  that’s  the  impression  we  have  at  this  stage. Alberto  laughs  at  his minutely detailed plans for the trip, according to which we should be nearing the end when in reality we have only just begun.  \\n We left Gesel  stocked up on vegetables and tinned meat “donated” by my uncle. He asked us to send him a telegram from Bariloche — if we get there — so that with the number of the telegram he could buy a corresponding lottery ticket, which seemed a little optimistic to us. On cue, others taunted that the bike would be a good excuse to go jogging, etc., and though we have a firm resolve to  prove  them  wrong,  a  natural  apprehension  keeps  us  from  declaring  our  confidence  in  the journey’s success.  \\n Along the coast road Comeback maintains his aviator’s impulses, emerging unscathed from yet  another  head-on  col ision.  The  motorbike  is  very  hard  to  control,  with  extra  weight  on  a  rack behind the center of gravity tending to lift the front wheel, and the slightest lapse in concentration \\n \\n sends us flying. We stop at a butcher store and buy some meat to gril  and milk for the dog, who won’t even try it. I begin to worry more about the little animal’s health than the money I’d forked out to pay for the milk. The meat turns out to be horse. It’s unbearably sweet and we can’t eat it. Fed up, I toss a piece away and amazingly, the dog wolfs it down in no time. I throw him another piece and the  same  thing  happens.  His  regime  of  milk  is  lifted.  In  the  middle  of  the  uproar  caused  by Comeback’s admirers I enter, here in Miramar, a… \\n *The English nickname Ernesto has given to the little dog he’s taking to Chichina, his girlfriend who is holidaying in Miramar.  \\n …PARÉNTESIS AMOROSO \\n …lovesick pause \\n \\n The intention of this diary is not real y to recount those days in Miramar where Comeback found a new home, with one resident in particular to whom Comeback’s name was directed. Our journey was suspended in that haven of indecision, subordinate to the words that give consent and create bonds.  \\n Alberto  saw  the  danger  and  was  already  imagining  himself  alone  on  the  roads  of America, though  he  never  raised  his  voice.  The  struggle  was  between  she  and  I.  For  a  moment  as  I  left, victorious, or so I thought, Otero Silva’s lines rang in my ears: I heard splashing on the boat \\n her bare feet \\n And sensed in our faces \\n the hungry dusk \\n My heart swaying between her \\n and the street, the road \\n I don’t know where I found the strength \\n to free myself from her eyes \\n to slip from her arms \\n She stayed, crying through rain and glass \\n clouded with grief and tears \\n She stayed, unable to cry \\n Wait! I will come \\n walking with you.* \\n \\n Yet afterwards I doubted whether driftwood has the right to say, “I win,” when the tide throws it on to the beach it seeks. But that was later, and is of no interest to the present. The two days I’d planned stretched like elastic into eight and with the bittersweet taste of goodbye mingling with my inveterate bad  breath  I  final y  felt  myself  lifted  definitively  away  on  the  winds  of  adventure  toward  worlds  I envisaged would be stranger than they were, into situations I imagined would be much more normal than they turned out to be.  \\n I remember the day my friend the sea came to my defense — taking me from the limbo I was cursed with. The beach was deserted and a cold onshore wind was blowing. My head rested in the lap  tying  me  to  this  land,  lul ed  by  everything  around.  The  entire  universe  drifted  rhythmical y  by, obeying the impulses of my inner voice. Suddenly, a stronger gust of wind brought a different sea voice and I lifted my head in surprise, yet it seemed to be nothing, a false alarm. I lay back, returning once  again  in  my  dreams  to  the  caressing  lap. And  then,  for  the  last  time,  I  heard  the  ocean’s warning. Its vast and jarring rhythm hammered at the fortress within me and threatened its imposing serenity.  \\n We became cold and left the beach, fleeing the disturbing presence which refused to leave me alone. The sea danced on the smal  stretch of beach, indifferent to its own eternal law and spawning its own note of caution, its warning. But a man in love (though Alberto used a more outrageous, less refined word) is in no condition to listen to such a cal  from nature; in the enormous bel y of a Buick the bourgeois side of my universe was stil  under construction.  \\n The first commandment for every good explorer is that an expedition has two points: the point of departure and the point of arrival. If your intention is to make the second theoretical point coincide with the actual point of arrival, don’t think about the means — because the journey is a virtual space that finishes when it finishes, and there are as many means as there are different ways of “finishing.”  \\n That is to say, the means are endless.  \\n I remembered Alberto’s suggestion: “The bracelet, or you’re not who you think you are.”  \\n Chichina’s hands disappeared into the hol ow made by mine.  \\n “Chichina, that bracelet… Can I take it to guide me and remind me of you?”  \\n The poor girl! I know the gold didn’t matter, despite what they say; her fingers as they held the bracelet were merely weighing up the love that made me ask for it. That is, at least, what I honestly think. Alberto says (with a certain mischievousness, it seems to me), that you don’t need particularly sensitive fingers to weigh up the ful  29 carats of my love.  \\n *Miguel Otero Silva, left-wing Venezuelan poet and novelist, born in 1908.  \\n HASTA ROMPER EL ULTIMO VÍNCULO \\n until the last tie is broken \\n \\n We left, stopping next in Necochea where an old university friend of Alberto’s had his practise. We covered the distance easily in a morning, arriving just in time for a steak lunch, receiving a genial welcome from the friend and a not so genial welcome from his wife who spotted the danger in our resolutely bohemian ways.  \\n “You  have  only  one  year  left  before  you  qualify  as  a  doctor  and  yet  you’re  going  away?  You have no idea when you’l  be back? But why?”  \\n We couldn’t give precise answers to her desperate questions and this horrified her. She was courteous with us but her hostility was clear, despite the fact that she knew (at least I think she knew) ultimate victory was hers — her husband was beyond our “redemption.”  \\n In Mar del Plata we had visited a doctor friend of Alberto’s who had joined the [Peronist] party, with  al   its  consequent  privileges.  This  doctor  in  Necochea  remained  faithful  to  his  own  —  the Radicals — yet we, however, were as remote from one as from the other. Support for the Radicals was never a tenable political position for me and was also losing its significance for Alberto, who had been quite close at one time with some of the leaders he respected.  \\n When we climbed back on to the bike again, after thanking the couple for our three days of the good life, we continued on to Bahía Blanca, feeling a little more alone but a good deal more free.  \\n Friends  were  also  expecting  us  there,  my  friends  this  time,  and  they  too  offered  us  warm  and friendly  hospitality.  Several  days  passed  us  by  in  this  southern  port,  as  we  fixed  the  bike  and wandered  aimlessly  around  the  city.  These  were  the  last  days  in  which  we  did  not  have  to  think about money. Afterwards, a rigid diet of meat, polenta and bread would have to be fol owed strictly to stretch our meager finances. The taste of bread was now tinged with warning: “I won’t be so easy to  come  by  soon,  old  man,”  and  we  swal owed  it  with  al   the  more  enthusiasm.  We  wanted,  like camels, to build our reserves for the journey that lay ahead.  \\n The night before our departure I came down with a cough and quite a high temperature, and consequently  we  were  a  day  late  leaving  Bahía  Blanca.  Final y,  at  three  in  the  afternoon,  we  left under a blazing sun that had become even hotter by the time we reached the sand dunes around Médanos.  The  bike,  with  its  badly  distributed  weight,  kept  bounding  out  of  control,  the  wheels constantly spinning over. Alberto fought a painful battle with the sand and insists he won. The only certainty is that we found ourselves resting comfortably in the sand six times before we final y made it out on to the flat. We did, nevertheless, get out, and this is my   compañero ’s main argument for claiming victory over Médanos.  \\n From here I took over the controls, accelerating to make up for precious lost time. A fine sand \\n \\n covered part of a bend and — boom: the worst crash of the whole trip. Alberto emerged unscathed but  my  foot  was  trapped  and  scorched  by  the  cylinder,  leaving  a  disagreeable  memento  which lasted a long time because the wound wouldn’t heal.  \\n A  heavy  downpour  forced  us  to  seek  shelter  at  a  ranch,  but  to  reach  it  we  had  to  get  300 \\n meters up a muddy track and we went flying twice more. Their welcome was magnificent but the sum total of our first experience on unsealed roads was alarming: nine crashes in a single day. On camp beds, the only beds we’d know from now on, and lying beside La Poderosa, our snail-like dwel ing,  we  stil   looked  into  the  future  with  impatient  joy.  We  seemed  to  breathe  more  freely,  a lighter air, an air of adventure. Distant countries, heroic deeds and beautiful women spun around and around in our turbulent imaginations.  \\n My  tired  eyes  refused  to  sleep  and  in  them  a  pair  of  green  spots  swirled,  representing  the world I had left for dead behind me and mocking the so-cal ed liberation I sought. They harnessed their image to my extraordinary flight across the lands and seas of the world.  \\n PARA LAS GRIPES, CAMA \\n for the flu, bed \\n \\n The  bike  exhaled  with  boredom  along  the  long  accident-free  road  and  we  exhaled  with  fatigue.  \\n Driving  on  a  gravel-covered  road  had  transformed  a  pleasant  jaunt  into  a  heavy  job.  By  nightfal , after an entire day of alternating turns at the controls, we were left with more desire to sleep than to continue  with  the  effort  to  reach  Choele  Choel,  a  largish  town  where  we  had  a  chance  at  free lodging.  So  we  stopped  in  Benjamín  Zorril a,  settling  down  comfortably  in  a  room  at  the  railroad station. We slept, dead to the world.  \\n We  woke  early  the  next  morning,  but  when  I  went  to  col ect  water  for  our   mate   a  weird sensation  darted  through  my  body,  fol owed  by  a  long  shiver.  Ten  minutes  later  I  was  shaking uncontrol ably like someone possessed. My quinine tablets made no difference, my head was like a drum hammering out strange rhythms, bizarre colors shifted shapelessly across the wal s and some desperate heaving produced a green vomit. I spent the whole day like this, unable to eat, until by the evening  I  felt  wel   enough  to  climb  on  the  bike  and,  sleeping  on Alberto’s  shoulder,  we  reached Choele  Choel.  There  we  visited  Dr.  Barrera,  director  of  the  little  hospital  and  a  member  of parliament.  He  received  us  amiably,  giving  us  a  room  to  sleep  in.  He  prescribed  a  course  of penicil in and within four hours my temperature had lowered, but whenever we talked about leaving \\n the doctor shook his head and said, “For the flu: bed.” (This was his diagnosis, for want of a better one.) So we spent several days there, being cared for royal y.  \\n Alberto photographed me in my hospital gear. I made an impressive spectacle: gaunt, flushed, enormous eyes and a ridiculous beard whose shape didn’t change much in al  the months I wore it.  \\n It’s  a  pity  the  photograph  wasn’t  a  good  one;  it  was  an  acknowledgment  of  our  changed circumstances and of the horizons we were seeking, free at last from “civilization.”  \\n One morning the doctor didn’t shake his head in his usual way. That was enough. Within the hour  we  were  gone,  heading  west  toward  our  next  destination  —  the  lakes.  The  bike  struggled, showing signs it was feeling the strain, especial y in the bodywork which we constantly had to fix with Alberto’s favored spare part — wire. He picked up this quote from somewhere, I don’t know where, attributing it to Oscar Gálvez:* “When a piece of wire can replace a screw, give me the wire, it’s safer.” Our hands and our pants were unequivocal proof that we were with Gálvez, at least on the question of wire.  \\n It was already night, yet we were trying to reach human habitation; we had no headlight and spending  the  night  in  the  open  didn’t  seem  much  like  a  pleasant  idea.  We  were  moving  slowly, using a torch, when a strange noise rang out from the bike that we couldn’t identify. The torch didn’t give  out  enough  light  to  find  the  cause  and  we  had  no  choice  but  to  camp  where  we  were.  We settled down as best we could, erecting our tent and crawling into it, hoping to suffocate our hunger and thirst (for there was no water nearby and we had no meat) with some exhausted sleep. In no time, however, the light evening breeze became a violent wind, uprooting our tent and exposing us to the elements and the worsening cold. We had to tie the bike to a telephone pole and, throwing the tent over the bike for protection, we lay down behind it. The near hurricane prevented us from using our camp beds. In no way was it an enjoyable night, but sleep final y won out over the cold, the wind and everything else, and we woke at nine in the morning with the sun high above our heads.  \\n By the light of day, we discovered that the infamous noise had been the front part of the bike frame breaking. We now had to fix it as best we could and find a town where we could weld the broken  bar.  Our  friend,  wire,  solved  the  problem  provisional y.  We  packed  up  and  set  off  not knowing exactly how far we were from nearest habitation. Our surprise was great when, coming out of only the second bend, we saw a house. They received us very wel , appeasing our hunger with exquisite  roast  lamb.  From  there  we  walked  20  kilometers  to  a  place  cal ed  Piedra  del  Águila where we were able to weld the part, but by then it was so late we decided to spend the night in the mechanic’s house.  \\n Except  for  a  couple  of  minor  spil s  that  didn’t  do  the  bike  too  much  damage,  we  continued calmly on toward San Martín de los Andes. We were almost there and I was driving when we took our first real fal  in the south [of Argentina] on a beautiful gravel bend, by a little bubbling stream. This time La Poderosa’s bodywork was damaged enough to force us to stop and, worst of al , we found we had what we most dreaded: a punctured back tire. In order to mend it, we had to take off al  the \\n \\n packs,  undo  the  wire  “securing”  the  rack,  then  struggle  with  the  wheel  cover  which  defied  our pathetic  crowbar.  Changing  the  flat  (lazily,  I  admit)  lost  us  two  hours.  Late  in  the  afternoon  we stopped at a ranch whose owners, very welcoming Germans, had by rare coincidence put up an uncle of mine in the past, an inveterate old traveler whose example I was now emulating. They let us fish  in  the  river  flowing  through  the  ranch.  Alberto  cast  his  line,  and  before  he  knew  what  was happening, he had jumping on the end of his hook an iridescent form glinting in the sunlight. It was a rainbow  trout,  a  beautiful,  tasty  fish  (even  more  so  when  baked  and  seasoned  by  our  hunger).  I prepared  the  fish  while Alberto,  enthusiastic  from  this  first  victory,  cast  his  line  again  and  again.  \\n Despite hours of trying he didn’t get a single bite. By then it was dark and we had to spend the night in the farm laborers’ kitchen.  \\n At five in the morning the huge stove occupying the middle of this kind of kitchen was lit and the whole  place  fil ed  with  smoke.  The  farm  laborers  passed  round  their  bitter   mate   and  cast aspersions on our own “ mate  for girls,” as they describe sweet   mate  in those parts. In general they didn’t try to communicate with us, as is typical of the subjugated Araucanian race who maintain a deep suspicion of the white man who in the past has brought them so much misfortune and now continues to exploit them. They answered our questions about the land and their work by shrugging their shoulders and saying “don’t know” or “maybe,” quickly ending the conversation.  \\n We were given the chance to stuff ourselves with cherries, so much so that by the time we were to move on to the plums I’d had enough and had to lie down to digest it al . Alberto ate some so as not to seem rude. Up the trees we ate avidly, as if we were racing each other to finish. One of the owner’s  sons  looked  on  with  a  certain  mistrust  at  these  “doctors,”  disgustingly  dressed  and obviously famished, but he kept his mouth shut and let us eat to our idealistic hearts’ content. It got to the point where we had to walk slowly to avoid stepping on our own stomachs.  \\n We mended the kick-start and other minor problems and set off again for San Martín de los Andes, where we arrived just before dark.  \\n *A champion Argentine rally driver.  \\n SAN MARTÍN DE LOS ANDES \\n san martín de los andes \\n \\n The  road  snakes  between  the  low  foothil s  that  sound  the  beginning  of  the  great  cordil era  of  the \\n Andes, then descends steeply until it reaches an unattractive, miserable town, surrounded in sharp contrast by magnificent, densely wooded mountains. San Martín lies on the yel ow-green slopes that melt  into  the  blue  depths  of  Lake  Lacar,  a  narrow  tongue  of  water  35  meters  wide  and  500 \\n kilometers  long.  The  day  it  was  “discovered”  as  a  tourist  haven  the  town’s  climate  and  transport difficulties were solved and its subsistence secured.  \\n Our first attack on the local clinic completely failed but we were told to try the same tactic at the National Parks’ offices. The superintendent of the park al owed us to stay in one of the tool sheds.  \\n The nightwatchman arrived, a huge, fat man weighing 140 kilos with a face as hard as nails, but he treated us very amiably, granting us permission to cook in his hut. That first night passed perfectly.  \\n We slept in the shed, content and warm on straw — certainly necessary in those parts where the nights are particularly cold.  \\n We  bought  some  beef  and  set  off  to  walk  along  the  shores  of  the  lake.  In  the  shade  of  the immense trees, where the wilderness had arrested the advance of civilization, we made plans to build a laboratory in this place, when we finished our trip. We imagined great windows that would take in the whole lake, winter blanketing the ground in white; the dinghy we would use to travel from one side to the other; catching fish from a little boat; everlasting excursions into the almost virgin forest.  \\n Although often on our travels we longed to stay in the formidable places we visited, only the Amazon jungle cal ed out to that sedentary part of ourselves as strongly as did this place.  \\n I  now  know,  by  an  almost  fatalistic  conformity  with  the  facts,  that  my  destiny  is  to  travel,  or perhaps it’s better to say that traveling is our destiny, because Alberto feels the same. Stil , there are moments when I think with profound longing of those wonderful areas in our south. Perhaps one day, tired of circling the world, I’l  return to Argentina and settle in the Andean lakes, if not indefinitely then at least for a pause while I shift from one understanding of the world to another.  \\n At dusk we started back and it was dark before we arrived. We were pleasantly surprised to find that Don Pedro Olate, the night-watchman, had prepared a wonderful barbecue to treat us. We bought wine to return the gesture and ate like lions, just for a change. We were discussing how tasty the meat was and how soon we wouldn’t be eating as extravagantly as we had done in Argentina, when Don Pedro told us he’d been asked to organize a barbecue for the drivers of a motor race taking place on the local track that coming Sunday. He wanted two helpers and offered us the job.  \\n “Mind that I can’t pay you, but you can stock up on meat for later.”  \\n It  seemed  like  a  good  idea  and  we  accepted  the  jobs  of  first  and  second  assistants  to  the \\n “Granddaddy of the Southern Argentine Barbecue.”  \\n Both assistants waited for Sunday with a kind of religious enthusiasm. At six in the morning on the day, we started our first job — loading wood on to a truck and taking it to the barbecue site — \\n and  we  didn’t  stop  work  until  11  a.m.  when  the  distinctive  signal  was  given  and  everyone  threw \\n themselves voraciously on to the tasty ribs.  \\n A  very  strange  person  was  giving  orders  whom  I  addressed  with  the  utmost  respect  as \\n “Señora” any time I said a word, until one of my fel ow workers said: “Hey kid,   che , don’t push Don Pendón too far, he’l  get angry.”  \\n “Who’s Don Pendón?” I asked, with the kind of gesture some uncultured kid would give. The answer, that Don Pendón was the Señora, left me cold, but not for long.  \\n As always at barbecues, there was far too much meat for everyone, so we were given carte blanche to pursue our vocation as camels. We executed, furthermore, a careful y calculated plan. I pretended to get drunker and drunker and, with every apparent attack of nausea, I staggered off to the stream, a bottle of red wine hidden inside my leather jacket. After five attacks of this type we had the same number of liters of wine stored beneath the fronds of a wil ow, keeping cool in the water. When everything was over and the moment came to pack up the truck and return to town, I kept  up  my  part,  working  reluctantly  and  bickering  constantly  with  Don  Pendón.  To  finish  my performance I lay down flat on my back in the grass, utterly unable to take another step. Alberto, acting like a true friend, apologized for my behavior to the boss and stayed behind to look after me as the truck left. When the noise of the engine faded in the distance we jumped up and raced off like colts to the wine that would guarantee us several days of kingly consumption.  \\n Alberto made it first and threw himself under the wil ow: his face was straight out of a comic film. Not a single bottle remained. Either my drunken state hadn’t fooled anyone, or someone had seen me sneak off with the wine. The fact was, we were as broke as ever, retracing in our minds the smiles that had greeted my drunken antics, trying to find some trace of the irony with which we could identify the thief. To no avail. Lugging the chunk of bread and cheese we’d received and a few kilos of meat for the night, we had to walk back to town. We were wel -fed and wel -watered, but with our tails between our legs, not so much for the wine but for the fools they’d made of us. Words cannot describe it.  \\n The  fol owing  day  was  rainy  and  cold  and  we  thought  the  race  wouldn’t  go  ahead.  We  were waiting for a break in the rain so we could go and cook some meat by the lake when we heard over the loudspeakers that the race was stil  on. In our role as barbecue assistants we passed free of charge through the entrance gates and, comfortably instal ed, watched the nation’s drivers in a fairly good car race.  \\n Just as we were thinking of moving on, discussing the best road to take and drinking   mate   in the  doorway  of  our  shed,  a  jeep  arrived,  carrying  some  of Alberto’s  friends  from  the  distant  and almost  mythical  Vil a  Concepción  del  Tío.  We  shared  big  friendly  hugs  and  went  immediately  to celebrate by fil ing our guts with frothy liquid, as is the dignified practise on such occasions.  \\n They invited us to visit them in the town where they were working, Junín de los Andes, and so we went, lessening the bike’s load by leaving our gear in the National Parks’ shed.  \\n \\n EXPLORACIÓN CIRCUNVALATORIA \\n circular exploration \\n \\n Junín  de  los  Andes,  less  fortunate  than  its  lakeside  brother,  vegetates  in  a  forgotten  corner  of civilization, unable to break free of the monotony of its stagnant life, despite attempts to invigorate the town by building a barracks where our friends were working. I say our friends, because in no time at al  they were mine too.  \\n We  dedicated  the  first  night  to  reminiscing  about  that  distant  past  in  Vil a  Concepción,  our mood  enhanced  by  seemingly  unlimited  bottles  of  red  wine.  My  lack  of  training  meant  I  had  to abandon the match and, in honor of the real bed, I slept like a log.  \\n We  spent  the  next  day  fixing  a  few  of  the  bike’s  problems  in  the  workshop  of  the  company where our friends worked. That night they gave us a magnificent farewel  from Argentina: a beef and lamb barbecue, with bread and gravy and a superb salad. After several days of partying, we left, departing with many hugs on the road to Carrué, another lake in the region. The road is terrible and our poor bike snorted about in the sand as I tried to help it out of the dunes. The first five kilometers took us an hour and a half, but later the road improved and we arrived without any other hitches at Carrué Chico, a little blue-green lake surrounded by wildly forested hil s, and then at Carrué Grande, a more expansive lake but sadly impossible to ride around on a bike because there is only a bridle path used by local smugglers to cross over to Chile.  \\n We left the bike at the cabin of a park ranger who wasn’t home, and took off to climb the peak facing the lake. It was nearing lunchtime and our supplies consisted only of a piece of cheese and some preserves. A duck passed, flying high over the lake. Alberto calculated the distance of the bird, the absence of the warden, the possibility of a fine, etc., and fired. By a masterful stroke of good luck (though not for the duck), the bird fel  into the lake. A discussion immediately ensued as to who would go and get it. I lost and plunged in. It seemed that fingers of ice were gripping me al over  my  body,  almost  completely  impeding  my  movement. Al ergic  as  I  am  to  the  cold,  those  20 \\n meters there and back that I swam to retrieve what Alberto had shot down made me suffer like a Bedouin. Just as wel  that roast duck, flavored as usual with our hunger, is one exquisite dish.  \\n Invigorated by lunch, we set off with enthusiasm on the climb. From the start, however, we were joined by flies that circled us ceaselessly, biting when they got the chance. The climb was gruel ing \\n \\n because  we  lacked  appropriate  equipment  and  experience,  but  some  weary  hours  later  we reached the summit. To our disappointment, there was no panoramic view to admire; neighboring mountains blocked everything. Whichever way we looked a higher peak was in the way. After some minutes of joking about in the patch of snow crowning the peak, we took to the task of descending, spurred on by the fact that darkness would soon be closing in. The first part was easy, but then the stream  that  was  guiding  our  descent  began  to  grow  into  a  torrent  with  steep,  smooth  sides  and slippery rocks that were difficult to walk on. We had to push our way through wil ows on the edge, final y reaching an area of thick, treacherous reeds. As night fel  it brought us a thousand strange noises and the sensation of walking into empty space with each step. Alberto lost his goggles and my pants were reduced to rags. We arrived, final y, at the tree line and from there we took every step  with  infinite  caution,  because  the  darkness  was  so  complete  and  our  sixth  sense  so heightened that we saw abysses every second moment.  \\n After an eternity of trekking through deep mud we recognized the stream flowing out into the Carrué, and almost immediately the trees disappeared and we reached the flat. The huge figure of a stag dashed like a quick breath across the stream and his body, silver by the light of the rising moon, disappeared into the undergrowth. This tremor of nature cut straight to our hearts. We walked slowly so as not to disturb the peace of the wild sanctuary with which we were now communing.  \\n We  waded  across  the  thread  of  water,  whose  touch  against  our  ankles  gave  me  a  sharp reminder of those ice fingers I hate so much, and reached the shelter of the ranger’s cabin. He was kind enough to offer us hot   mate  and sheepskins to sleep on til  the fol owing morning. It was 12:35 \\n a.m.  \\n We drove slowly on the way back, passing lakes of only a hybrid beauty compared to Carrué, and  final y  reached  San  Martín  where  Don  Pendón  gave  us  10  pesos  each  for  working  at  the barbecue. Then we set off further south.  \\n QUERIDA VIEJA \\n dear mama \\n \\n   January 1952 \\n   En route to Bariloche \\n   Dear Mama ,  \\n \\n Just as you have not heard from me, I’ve had no news from you and I’m worried. It would defeat the purpose  of  these  few  lines  to  tel   you  al   that  has  happened  to  us;  I’l   just  say  that  two  days  after leaving Bahía Blanca I fel  il  with a temperature of 40 degrees which kept me in bed for a day. The fol owing morning I managed to get up only to end up in the Choele Choel regional hospital where I was given a dose of a little-known drug, penicil in, and recovered four days later… \\n We reached San Martín de los Andes, using our usual resourcefulness to solve the thousand problems  that  plagued  us  along  the  way.  San  Martín  de  los  Andes  has  a  beautiful  lake  and  is wonderful y set amid virgin forest. You must see it, I’m sure you’d find it worthwhile. Our faces are beginning to resemble the texture of Carborundum. Any house we come across that has a garden, we seek food, lodging and whatever else is on offer. We ended up at the Von Putnamers’ ranch, they’re friends of Jorge’s, particularly one who’s a Peronist, always drunk, and the best of the three. I was able to diagnose a tumor in the occipital zone that was probably of hydatic origin. We’l  have to wait and see what happens. We wil  leave for Bariloche in two or three days and intend to travel at a leisurely pace. Send me a letter poste restante if it can arrive by February 10 or 12. Wel , Mama, the next  page  I’m  writing  is  for  Chichina.  Send  lots  of  love  to  everyone  and  make  sure  you  tel   me whether or not Papi is in the south.  \\n A loving hug from your son.  \\n POR EL CAMINO DE LOS SIETE LAGOS \\n on the seven lakes road \\n \\n We decided to go to Bariloche by the Seven Lakes Road, named for the number of lakes the road skirts before reaching the town. We traveled the first few kilometers at La Poderosa’s ever tranquil pace, without any serious mechanical upsets until, with nightfal  catching up on us, we pul ed the old broken headlight trick so we could sleep in a road laborer’s hut, a handy ruse because the cold that night was uncommonly harsh. It was so fiercely cold that a visitor soon appeared asking to borrow some blankets because he and his wife were camping by the edge of lake and they were freezing.  \\n We went to share some   mate  with this stoical pair who for some time had been living beside the lakes with only a tent and the contents of their backpacks. They put us to shame.  \\n We set off again, passing greatly varying lakes, al  surrounded by ancient forest, the scent of wilderness caressing our nostrils. But curiously, the sight of a lake and a forest and a single solitary house with a wel -tended garden soon begins to grate. Seeing the landscape at this superficial level \\n only captures its boring uniformity, not al owing you to immerse yourself in the spirit of the place; for that you must stop at least several days.  \\n We  final y  reached  the  northern  end  of  Lake  Nahuel  Huapí  and  slept  on  its  banks,  ful   and content after the enormous barbecue we had eaten. But when we hit the road again, we noticed a puncture in the back tire and from then began a tedious battle with the inner tube. Each time we patched up one side, the other side of the tube punctured, until we were al  out of patches and were forced to spend the night where we were. An Austrian caretaker who had raced motorbikes as a young  man  gave  us  a  place  to  stay  in  an  empty  shed,  caught  between  his  desire  to  help  fel ow bikers in need and fear of his boss.  \\n In his broken Spanish he told us that a puma was in the region. “And pumas are vicious, they’re not afraid to attack people! They have huge blond manes…”  \\n Attempting to close the door we found that it was like a stable door — only the lower half shut. I placed our revolver near my head in case the puma, whose shadow fil ed our thoughts, decided to pay an unannounced midnight visit. The day was just dawning when I awoke to the sound of claws scratching  at  the  door. At  my  side, Alberto  lay  silent,  ful   of  dread.  I  had  my  hand  tensed  on  the cocked revolver. Two luminous eyes stared at me from the silhouetted trees. Like a cat, the eyes sprang forward and the black mass of the body materialized over the door.  \\n It was pure instinct; the brakes of intel igence failed. My drive for self-preservation pul ed the trigger. For a long moment, the thunder beat against and around the wal s, stopping only when a lighted torch in the doorway began desperately shouting at us. But by that time in our timid silence we knew, or could at least guess, the reason for the caretaker’s stentorian shouts and his wife’s hysterical sobs as she threw herself over the dead body of Bobby — her nasty, il -tempered dog.  \\n Alberto went to Angostura to get the tire fixed and I thought I’d have to spend the night in the open, being unable to ask for a bed in a house where we were considered murderers. Luckily our bike was near another road laborer’s hut and he let me sleep in the kitchen with a friend of his. At midnight I woke to the noise of rain and was going to get up to cover the bike with a tarpaulin. But before doing so, I decided to take a few puffs from my asthma inhaler, irritated by the sheepskin I was using for a pil ow. As I inhaled, my sleeping companion woke up, hearing the puff. He made a sudden  movement,  then  immediately  fel   silent.  I  sensed  his  body  go  rigid  under  his  blankets, clutching a knife, holding his breath. With the experience of the previous night stil  fresh, I decided to remain where I was for fear of being knifed, just in case mirages were contagious in those parts.  \\n We reached San Carlos de Bariloche by the evening of the next day and spent the night in the police station waiting for the   Modesta Victoria  to sail toward the border with Chile.  \\n \\n Y YA SIENTO FLOTAR MI GRAN RAÍZ LIBRE Y DESNUDA… Y \\n and now, I feel my great roots unearth, free and… \\n \\n In the kitchen of the police station we were sheltering from a storm unleashing its total fury outside. I read  and  reread  the  incredible  letter.  Just  like  that,  al   my  dreams  of  home,  bound  up  with  those eyes  that  saw  me  off  in  Miramar,  came  crashing  down  for  what  seemed  like  no  reason. A  great exhaustion  enveloped  me  and,  half  asleep,  I  listened  to  the  lively  conversation  of  a  globetrotting prisoner as he concocted a thousand exotic brews, safe in the ignorance of his audience. I could make out his warm, seductive words while the faces surrounding him leaned closer so as better to hear his stories unfold.  \\n As  if  through  a  distant  fog  I  could  see  an American  doctor  we  had  met  there  in  Bariloche nodding:  “I  think  you’l   get  where  you’re  heading,  you’ve  got  guts.  But  I  think  you’l   stay  a  while  in Mexico. It’s a wonderful country.”  \\n I suddenly felt myself flying off with the sailor to far-off lands, far away the current drama of my life. A  feeling  of  profound  unease  came  over  me;  I  felt  that  I  was  incapable  of  feeling  anything.  I began to feel afraid for myself and started a tearful letter, but I couldn’t write, it was hopeless to try.  \\n In the half-light that surrounded us, phantoms swirled around and around but “she” wouldn’t appear. I stil  believed I loved her until this moment, when I realized I felt nothing.  \\n I had to summon her back with my mind. I had to fight for her, she was mine, mine… I slept.  \\n A  gentle  sun  il uminated  the  new  day,  our  day  of  departure,  our  farewel   to  Argentine  soil.  \\n Carrying the bike on to the   Modesta Victoria  was not an easy task, but with patience we eventual y did it. Getting it off again was equal y hard. Then we were in that tiny spot by the lake, pompously named  Puerto  Blest. A  few  kilometers  on  the  road,  three  or  four  at  most,  and  we  were  back  on water, a dirty green lake this time, Lake Frías.  \\n A short voyage before final y reaching customs, then the Chilean immigration post on the other side of the cordil era — much lower at this latitude. There we crossed yet another lake fed by the waters  of  the  Tronador  River  that  originate  in  the  majestic  volcano  sharing  the  same  name.  This lake, Esmeralda, in contrast to the Argentine lakes, offered wonderful, temperate water, making the task of bathing very enjoyable and much more enticing. High in the cordil era at a place cal ed Casa Pangue there is a lookout that affords a beautiful view over Chile. It is a kind of crossroads; at least \\n \\n in that moment it was for me. I was looking to the future, through the narrow band of Chile and to what lay beyond, turning the lines of the Otero Silva poem over in my mind.  \\n OBJETOS CURIOSOS \\n objects of curiosity \\n \\n Water  leaked  from  every  pore  of  the  big  old  tub  carrying  our  bike.  Daydreams  took  me  soaring away while I maintained my rhythm at the pump. A doctor, returning from Peul a in the passenger launch that ran back and forth across Esmeralda, passed the hulking great contraption our bike was lashed to and where we were paying for both our and La Poderosa’s passage with the sweat of our brows. A curious expression came across his face as he watched us struggling to keep the vessel afloat, naked and almost swimming in the oily pump-water.  \\n We  had  met  several  doctors  traveling  down  there  who  we  lectured  about  leprology, embel ishing  a  bit,  provoking  the  admiration  of  our  col eagues  from  the  other  side  of  the Andes.  \\n They were impressed because, since leprosy is not a problem in Chile, they didn’t know the first thing about it or about lepers and confessed honestly that never in their lives had they even seen a leper. They told us about the distant leper colony on Easter Island where a smal  number of lepers were living; it was a delightful island, they said, and our scientific interests were excited.  \\n This doctor generously offered us any help we might need, given the “very interesting journey”  \\n we were making. But in those happy days in the south of Chile, when our stomachs were stil  ful  and we  were  not  yet  total y  brazen,  we  merely  asked  him  for  an  introduction  to  the  president  of  the Friends of Easter Island, who lived near them in Valparaíso. Of course, he was delighted.  \\n The lake route ended in Petrohué where we said goodbye to everyone; but not before posing for some black Brazilian girls who placed us in their souvenir album for southern Chile, and for an environmentalist  couple  from  who  knows  what  European  country,  who  noted  our  addresses ceremoniously so they could send us copies of the photos.  \\n There was a character in the little town who wanted a station wagon driven to Osorno, where we were heading, and he asked me if I would do it. Alberto gave me a high-speed lesson in gear changes and I went off in al  solemnity to assume my post. Rather cartoon-like, I set off with hops and jerks behind Alberto who was riding the bike. Every corner was a torment: brake, clutch, first, second, help,   Mamáaa … The road wound through beautiful countryside, skirting Lake Osorno, the \\n \\n volcano  with  the  same  name  a  sentinel  above  us.  Unfortunately  I  was  in  no  position  along  that accident-studded road to appreciate the landscape. The only accident, however, was suffered by a little pig that ran in front of the car while we were speeding down a hil , before I was ful y practised in the art of braking and clutching.  \\n We  arrived  in  Osorno,  we  scrounged  around  in  Osorno,  we  left  Osorno  and  continued  ever northward  through  the  delightful  Chilean  countryside,  divided  into  plots,  every  bit  farmed,  in  stark contrast  to  our  own  arid  south.  The  Chileans,  exceedingly  friendly  people,  were  warm  and welcoming  wherever  we  went.  Final y  we  arrived  in  the  port  of  Valdivia  on  a  Sunday.  Ambling around the city, we dropped into the local newspaper, the    Correo de Valdivia , and they very kindly wrote  an  article  about  us.  Valdivia  was  celebrating  its  fourth  centenary  and  we  dedicated  our journey to the city in tribute to the great conquistador whose name the city bears. They persuaded us  to  write  a  letter  to  Molinas  Luco,  the  mayor  of  Valparaíso,  preparing  him  for  our  great  Easter Island scam.  \\n The harbor, overflowing with goods that were completely foreign to us, the market where they sold different foods, the typical y Chilean wooden houses, the special clothes of the   guasos,*  were notably  different  from  what  we  knew  back  home;  there  was  something  indigenously  American, untouched by the exoticism invading our   pampas . This may be because Anglo-Saxon immigrants in Chile do not mix, thus preserving the purity of the indigenous race, which in our country is practical y nonexistent.  \\n But  for  al   the  customary  and  idiomatic  differences  distinguishing  us  from  our  thin  Andean brother, there is one cry that seems international: “Give them water,” the salutation greeting the sight of my calf-length trousers, not my personal taste but a fashion inherited from a generous, if short, friend.  \\n *Chilean peasants.  \\n LOS EXPERTOS \\n the experts \\n \\n Chilean hospitality, as I never tire of saying, is one reason traveling in our neighboring country is so enjoyable. And  we  made  the  most  of  it.  I  woke  up  gradual y  beneath  the  sheets,  considering  the value  of  a  good  bed  and  calculating  the  calorie  content  of  the  previous  night’s  meal.  I  reviewed \\n recent events in my mind: the treacherous puncture of La Poderosa’s tire, which left us stranded in the rain and in the middle of nowhere; the generous help of Raúl, owner of the bed in which we were now sleeping; and the interview we gave to the paper   El Austral  in Temuco. Raúl was a veterinary student, not particularly studious it seemed, who had hoisted our poor old bike on to the truck he owned, bringing us to this quiet town in the middle of Chile. To be honest, there was probably a moment or two when our friend wished he’d never met us, since we caused him an uncomfortable night’s sleep, but he only had himself to blame, bragging about the money he spent on women and inviting us for a night out at a “cabaret,” which would be at his expense, of course. His invitation was the reason we prolonged our stay in the land of Pablo Neruda, and we became involved in a lively bragging session which lasted for some time. In the end, of course, he came clean on that inevitable problem  (lack  of  funds),  meaning  we  had  to  postpone  our  visit  to  that  very  interesting  place  of entertainment, though in compensation he gave us bed and board. So at one in the morning there we  were,  feeling  very  self-satisfied  and  devouring  everything  on  the  table,  quite  a  lot  real y,  plus some  more  that  arrived  later.  Then  we  appropriated  our  host’s  bed  as  his  father  was  being transferred to Santiago and there was not much furniture left in the house.  \\n Alberto, unmovable, was resisting the morning sun’s attempt to disturb his deep sleep, while I dressed slowly, a task we didn’t find particularly difficult because the difference between our night wear and day wear was made up, general y, of shoes. The newspaper flaunted a generous number of pages, very much in contrast to our poor and stunted dailies, but I wasn’t interested in anything besides one piece of local news I found in large type in section two: TWO ARGENTINE LEPROSY EXPERTS TOUR LATIN AMERICA BY MOTORCYCLE \\n \\n And then in smal er type: \\n \\n THEY ARE IN TEMUCO AND WANT TO VISIT RAPA-NUI* \\n \\n This  was  the  epitome  of  our  audacity.  Us,  experts,  key  figures  in  the  field  of  leprology  in  the Americas,  with  vast  experience,  having  treated  3,000  patients,  familiar  with  the  most  important leprosy centers of the continent and researchers into the sanitary conditions of those same centers, had  consented  to  visit  this  picturesque,  melancholy  little  town.  We  supposed  they  would  ful y appreciate our respect for the town, but we didn’t real y know. Soon the whole family was gathered around the article and al  other items in the paper became objects of Olympian contempt. And so, like this, basking in their admiration, we said goodbye to those people we remember nothing about, not even their names.  \\n We had asked permission to leave the bike in the garage of a man who lived on the outskirts of \\n \\n town and we made our way there, no longer a pair of more or less likable vagrants with a bike in tow;  no,  we  were  now  “The  Experts,”  and  we  were  treated  accordingly.  We  spent  the  whole  day fixing and conditioning the bike while every now and then a dark-skinned maid would arrive with little snacks. At five o’clock, after a delicious afternoon tea prepared by our host, we said goodbye to Temuco and headed north.  \\n \\n \\n *Easter Island.  \\n LAS DIFFICULTADES AUMENTAN \\n the difficulties intensify \\n \\n Our departure from Temuco went as normal until, on the road out of town, we noticed the back tire was punctured and we had to stop and fix it. We worked energetical y but no sooner had we put the spare on we saw it was losing air; it too was punctured. It seemed we would have to spend the night out  in  the  open  as  there  was  no  question  of  repairing  it  at  that  time  of  night.  But  we  weren’t  just anybody  now,  we  were  The  Experts;  we  soon  found  a  railroad  worker  who  took  us  to  his  house where we were treated like kings.  \\n Early next morning we took the inner tubes and tire to the garage to remove some bits of metal that had become embedded in them, and to patch the tire again. It was close to nightfal  when we left, but not before accepting an invitation to a typical Chilean meal: tripe and another similar dish, al  very spicy, washed down with a delicious rough wine. As usual, Chilean hospitality wiped us out.  \\n Of course we didn’t get much further, and less than 80 kilometers on we stopped to sleep in the house of a park ranger who was hoping for a tip. Because it never arrived he refused us breakfast the fol owing day, so we set off in bad humor intending to light a smal  fire and make some   mate  as soon as we’d done a few kilometers. We’d gone a little way and I was looking out for a good place to stop when, with no warning at al , the bike took a sharp twist sideways sending us flying to the ground. Alberto and I, unharmed, examined the bike — finding one of the steering columns broken and, most seriously, the gearbox smashed. It was impossible to go on. The only thing to do was wait patiently for an accommodating truck to take us as far as the next town.  \\n A  car  going  in  the  opposite  direction  stopped  and  its  occupants  got  out  to  see  what  had \\n \\n happened  and  offer  their  services.  They  told  us  they  would  do  everything  possible  to  help,  with whatever two scientists like ourselves needed.  \\n “Do you know, I recognized you straight away from the photo in the paper,” one of them said.  \\n But we had nothing to ask of them, except for a truck going the other way. We thanked them and settled down for the usual   mate  when the owner of a nearby shack came over and invited us in to his home. We downed a couple of liters in his kitchen. There we met with his   charango , a musical instrument  made  with  three  or  four  wires  some  two  meters  in  length  stretched  tightly  across  two empty tins fixed to a board. The musician uses a kind of metal knuckle-duster with which he plucks the wires producing a sound like a toy guitar. Around 12 a van came along whose driver, after much pleading, agreed to take us to the next town, Lautaro.  \\n We found a space in the best garage in the area and someone who would be able to do the soldering,  a  short  and  friendly  boy  cal ed  Luna  who  once  or  twice  took  us  home  for  lunch.  We divided our time between working on the bike and scrounging something to eat in the homes of the many curiosity seekers who came to see us at the garage. Next door was a German family, or one of German origin, who treated us handsomely. We slept in the local barracks.  \\n The bike was more or less fixed and we had decided to leave the fol owing day, so we thought we’d throw caution to the wind with some new pals who invited us for a few drinks. Chilean wine is great and I was drinking it unbelievably quickly, so much so that by the time we went on to the vil age dance  I  felt  ready  to  take  on  the  world.  The  evening  progressed  pleasantly  as  we  kept  fil ing  our bel ies and our heads with wine. One of the particularly friendly mechanics from the garage asked me to dance with his wife because he’d been mixing his drinks and was not feeling very wel . His wife was hot and clearly in the mood and, ful  of Chilean wine, I took her by the hand and tried to steer her outside. She fol owed me meekly but then noticed her husband watching us and told me she would stay behind. I was in no state to listen to reason and we began to argue in the middle of the dance floor. I started pul ing her toward one of the doors, while everybody was watching, and then she tried to kick me, and as I was pul ing her she lost her balance and fel  crashing to the floor.  \\n Running  back  toward  the  vil age,  pursued  by  a  furious  swarm  of  dancers,  Alberto  loudly mourned the loss of the wine her husband might have bought us.  \\n LA PODEROSA II TERMINA SU GIRA \\n la poderosa II’s final tour \\n \\n \\n We  rose  early  to  put  the  finishing  touches  on  the  bike  and  to  flee  what  was  no  longer  a  very hospitable place for us, but only after accepting a final invitation to lunch from the family who lived next to the garage.  \\n Due to a premonition, Alberto didn’t want to drive, so I sat up front though we only did a few kilometers before stopping to fix the failing gearbox. A little further on, as we rounded a tight curve at a good speed, the screw came off the back brake, a cow’s head appeared around the bend, then many, many more of them, and I threw on the hand brake which, soldered ineptly, also broke.  \\n For some moments I saw nothing more than the blurred shape of cattle flying past us on each side, while poor Poderosa gathered speed down the steep hil . By an absolute miracle we managed to graze only the leg of the last cow, but in the distance a river was screaming toward us with terrifying efficacy. I veered on to the side of the road and in the blink of an eye the bike mounted the two-meter bank, embedding us between two rocks, but we were unhurt.  \\n Ever  aided  by  the  letter  of  recommendation  from  the  “press,”  we  were  put  up  by  some Germans  who  treated  us  very  wel .  During  the  night  I  had  a  bad  case  of  the  runs  and,  being ashamed to leave a souvenir in the pot under my bed, I climbed out on to the window ledge and gave up al  of my pain to the night and blackness beyond. The next morning I looked out to see the effect  and  saw  that  two  meters  below  lay  a  big  sheet  of  tin  where  they  were  sun-drying  their peaches; the added spectacle was impressive. We beat it fast.  \\n Although at first glance the accident seemed to be of little importance, it quickly became clear we had underestimated the damage. The bike acted strangely every time it had to climb uphil . On the ascent to Mal eco, where there is a railroad bridge considered by Chileans to be the highest in the Americas, the bike packed it in and we wasted the whole day waiting for some charitable soul (embodied  in  the  shape  of  a  truck)  to  take  us  to  the  top.  We  slept  in  the  town  of  Cul ipul i,  after gaining the hoped-for lift, and left early, fearing impending catastrophe. On the first steep hil , one of many on that road, La Poderosa final y gave up the ghost. A truck took us to Los Ángeles where we left  her  in  the  fire  station  and  slept  at  the  house  of  a  Chilean  army  lieutenant  who  seemed  very thankful for the way he’d been treated in our country Argentina and couldn’t do enough to please us.  \\n It was our last day as “motorized bums”; the next stage seemed set to be more difficult, as “bums without wheels.”  \\n BOMBEROS VOLUNTARIOS, HOMBRES DE TRABAJO Y OTRAS YERBAS \\n firefighters, workers and other matters \\n \\n As  far  as  I  know  there  are  no  non-volunteer  fire  brigades  in  Chile,  but  even  so  it’s  a  very  good service because captaining a brigade is a sought-after honor for the most able men in the towns or districts where they operate. And don’t think it’s only a job in theory: in the south of the country at least,  fires  occur  with  astonishing  frequency.  I’m  not  sure  what  the  major  contributing  factor  is, whether it’s because most buildings are constructed with wood, or because the cultural level of the people is quite low and they do not have much education, or some other factor, or al  of them put together. What’s certain is that in the three days we stayed at the fire station there were two big fires and one smal  one (though I’m not suggesting this was average, just stating the facts.) I’ve forgotten to explain that after spending the night at the lieutenant’s house, we decided to move to the fire station, lured by the charms of the caretaker’s three daughters, exponents of the grace  of  Chilean  women  who,  ugly  or  beautiful,  have  a  certain  spontaneity  and  freshness  that captivates immediately. But I’m drifting from my point… They gave us a room where we set up our camp beds and fel  into them with our habitual sleep of the dead, meaning we didn’t hear the sirens.  \\n The volunteers on duty had no idea we were there and rushed off with their fire engines while we slept on until mid-morning, when we learned what had happened. We extracted promises from them to include us in the party for the next fire. We had found a truck that in two days would take us and the bike to Santiago for a low price, on condition that we helped them with the load of furniture they were moving.  \\n We made a very popular pair, with our abundant supply of conversation for the volunteers and the caretaker’s daughters, and the days in Los Ángeles flew by. In my eyes, constantly ordering and pencil ing in the past, the symbolic representation of the town wil  always be the furious flames of a fire. It was the last day of our stay and after numerous toasts expressing the beautiful sentiments of our goodbyes, we had curled up in our blankets and gone to sleep. The much-awaited siren tore through the night, cal ing and waking the volunteers on duty, tearing also through Alberto’s bed from which he sprang far too quickly. Soon we had taken our positions with the necessary gravity in the fire engine “Chile-España,”* which left the station at a breakneck speed, the long whine of its alarm alarming nobody, heard too often to constitute much of a novelty.  \\n As each surge of water fel  on to its flaming skeleton, the wood-and-adobe house shook. The acrid smoke of the burnt wood stood firm against the stoical work of the firefighters who, between fits  of  laughter,  protected  neighboring  houses  with  jets  of  water  or  by  other  means.  The  flames hadn’t reached a smal  part of the house and from there came the whimper of a cat who, terrorized by the fire, just meowed and meowed and refused to escape through the smal  space left. Alberto saw the danger, and measuring it with one quick look, leapt agilely over the 20 centimeters of flame, saving the little endangered life for its owners. Receiving effusive congratulations for his unrival ed \\n heroism, his eyes shone with pleasure from beneath the huge helmet he had borrowed.  \\n But everything comes to an end, and Los Ángeles gave us its final goodbye. Little Che and Big Che  (Alberto  and  I)  solemnly  shook  the  last  friendly  hands  as  the  truck  began  its  journey  to Santiago, carrying on its powerful back the corpse of La Poderosa I .  \\n On a Sunday we arrived in Santiago and as our first measure we went directly to the Austin garage. We had a letter of introduction to the owner but were unhappily surprised to find that it was closed. In the end we got the caretaker to accept the bike, and went off to pay for part of the trip with the sweat of our brows.  \\n Our  job  as  removalists  had  different  stages:  the  first,  particularly  interesting,  consisted  of consuming two kilos of grapes each in record time, assisted by the absence of the house owners; the second, their arrival and the heavy work which fol owed; the third, Alberto’s discovery that the truck driver’s col eague had an overactive ego, especial y with regard to his body — the poor guy won al  the bets we made with him by carrying more furniture than both us and the owner combined (the latter played the fool with barbaric ease).  \\n We’d  managed  to  track  down  our  consul  who  final y  turned  up  at  what  served  as  an  office, stone-faced  (fair  enough  considering  it  was  a  Sunday),  and  he  let  us  sleep  on  the  patio. After  a caustic diatribe regarding our duties as citizens, etc., he topped off his generosity by offering us 2 0 0   pesos   which  we,  taking  righteous  offense,  refused.  If  he’d  offered  it  three  months  later,  it would’ve been a different story. What a save!  \\n Santiago has more or less the same feel as Córdoba. Though its daily pace is much faster and its traffic considerably heavier, its buildings, the nature of its streets, its weather and even the faces of  its  people,  reminded  us  of  our  own  Mediterranean  city.  We  couldn’t  get  to  know  the  city  wel because we were there only a few days and were pressed for time with the many things we had to sort out before embarking once again.  \\n The Peruvian consul refused to issue us visas without a letter from his Argentine counterpart, which  the  latter  refused  to  give,  saying  the  bike  probably  wouldn’t  get  us  there  and  we’d  end  up asking  the  embassy  for  help  (the  little  angel  was  ignorant  of  the  fact  that  the  bike  was  already finished), but he final y relented and they gave us the visas for Peru, at a fee of 400 Chilean   pesos , a lot of cash for us. In those days the Suquía water polo team from Córdoba was visiting Santiago.  \\n Many of the guys were friends of ours, so we paid them a courtesy cal  while they were playing a match and got ourselves invited to one of those Chilean-style meals that go something like: “have some ham, try some cheese, drink a little more wine,” and that you stand up from — if you can — \\n straining al  the thorax muscles in your body. The fol owing day we climbed up Santa Lucía, a rocky formation in the center of the city with its own particular history, and were peaceful y performing the task  of  photographing  the  city  when  a  convoy  of  Suquía  members  arrived,  led  by  some  good lookers  from  the  host  club.  The  poor  guys  were  embarrassed  enough  —  unsure  of  whether  to introduce us to these “distinguished ladies of Chilean society,” as in the end they did, or play dumb \\n \\n and pretend not to know us (remember our unorthodox attire). But they managed the tight spot as skilful y as possible and were very friendly — as friendly as people could be from worlds as different as theirs and ours at that particular moment in our lives.  \\n The big day arrived at last and two tears ploughed symbolical y down Alberto’s cheeks. With one last goodbye to La Poderosa, left behind in the garage, we began our journey to Valparaíso.  \\n We set off along a magnificent mountain road, the most beautiful civilization could offer compared to  the  real  natural  wonders  (undamaged  by  human  hands,  that  is),  in  a  truck  bearing  the  heavy weight of us freeloaders.  \\n \\n *Almost all Chilean fire brigades have a sister city or country, in this case, Spain.  \\n LA SONRISA DE LA GIOCONDA \\n la gioconda’s smile \\n \\n We had come to a new phase in our adventure. We were used to cal ing idle attention to ourselves with our strange dress and the prosaic figure of La Poderosa I , whose asthmatic wheezing aroused pity in our hosts. To a certain extent we had been knights of the road; we belonged to that long-standing “wandering aristocracy” and had cal ing cards with our impeccable and impressive titles.  \\n No longer. Now we were just two hitchhikers with backpacks, and with al  the grime of the road stuck to our overal s, shadows of our former aristocratic selves.  \\n The truck driver had left us at the upper edge of the city, at its entrance, and with weary steps we dragged our packs down the streets, fol owed by the amused or indifferent glances of onlookers.  \\n ',\n",
       " 'In the distance the harbor radiated with the tempting glimmer of its boats, while the sea, black and inviting, cried out to us — its gray smel  dilating our nostrils. We bought bread — which seemed so expensive at the time though it became cheaper as we ventured further north — and kept walking downhil . Alberto wore his exhaustion obviously, and although I tried not to show it I was just as tired.  \\n So when we found a truck stop we assaulted the attendant with our tragic faces, relating in florid detail the hardships we had suffered on the long hard road from Santiago. He let us sleep on some wooden planks, in the company of some parasites whose name ends in   hominis , but at least we had a roof over our heads.  \\n We set about sleeping with determination. News of our arrival, however, reached the ears of a \\n fel ow-countryman instal ed in a cheap restaurant next to the trailer park, and he wanted to meet us.  \\n To meet in Chile signifies a certain hospitality and neither of us was in a position to turn down this manna from heaven. Our compatriot proved to be profoundly imbued with the spirit of the sisterland and consequently was fantastical y drunk. It was a long time since I’d eaten fish, and the wine was so delicious, and our host so attentive… Anyway, we ate wel  and he invited us to his house the fol owing day.  \\n La Gioconda threw open its doors early and we brewed our   mate , chatting with the owner who was  very  interested  in  our  journey.  After  that,  we  went  to  explore  the  city.  Valparaíso  is  very picturesque, built to the edge of the beach and overlooking a large bay. As it grew it clambered up the hil s that sweep down to their deaths in the sea. The madhouse museum beauty of its strange corrugated-iron  architecture,  arranged  on  a  series  of  tiers  linked  by  winding  flights  of  stairs  and funiculars, is heightened by the contrast of diversely colored houses blending with the leaden blue of the  bay. As  if  patiently  dissecting,  we  pry  into  dirty  stairways  and  dark  recesses,  talking  to  the swarms  of  beggars;  we  plumb  the  city’s  depths,  the  miasmas  draw  us  in.  Our  distended  nostrils inhale the poverty with sadistic intensity.  \\n We visited the ships down at the docks to see if any were going to Easter Island but the news was  disheartening:  it  would  be  six  months  before  any  boat  was  going  there.  We  col ected  some vague details about flights that left once a month.  \\n Easter  Island!  The  imagination  stops  in  its  ascending  flight  to  turn  somersaults  at  the  very thought: “Over there, having a white ‘boyfriend’ is an honor”; “Work? Ha! the women do everything \\n — you just eat, sleep and keep them content.” This marvel ous place where the weather is perfect, the women are perfect, the food perfect, the work perfect (in its beatific nonexistence). What does it matter if we stay there a year; who cares about studying, work, family, etc. In a shop window a giant crayfish  winks  at  us,  and  from  his  bed  of  lettuce  his  whole  body  tel s  us,  “I’m  from  Easter  Island, where the weather is perfect, the women are perfect…”  \\n In the doorway of La Gioconda we were waiting patiently for our compatriot to show up, who gave no sign of appearing, when the owner invited us in out of the sun and treated us to one of his magnificent  lunches  of  fried  fish  and  watery  soup.  We  never  heard  from  the  Argentine  again throughout our stay in Valparaíso, but we became great friends with the owner of the bar. He was a strange sort of guy, indolent and enormously generous to al  the riff raff who turned up, though he made normal customers pay colossal prices for the paltry cuisine he sold in his place. We didn’t pay  a  cent  the  whole  time  we  were  there  and  he  lavished  hospitality  on  us.  “Today  it’s  your  turn, tomorrow it’l  be mine” was his favorite saying; not very original but very effective.  \\n We tried to contact the doctors from Petrohué, but being back at work with no time to spare, they  never  agreed  to  meet  us  formal y. At  least  we  knew  more  or  less  where  they  were.  In  the afternoon we went our separate ways: while Alberto fol owed up the doctors, I went to see an old woman with asthma, a customer at La Gioconda. The poor thing was in a pitiful state, breathing the \\n acrid  smel   of  concentrated  sweat  and  dirty  feet  that  fil ed  her  room,  mixed  with  the  dust  from  a couple  of  armchairs,  the  only  luxury  items  in  her  house.  On  top  of  her  asthma,  she  had  a  heart condition. It is at times like this, when a doctor is conscious of his complete powerlessness, that he longs for change: a change to prevent the injustice of a system in which only a month ago this poor woman was stil  earning her living as a waitress, wheezing and panting but facing life with dignity. In circumstances like this, individuals in poor families who can’t pay their way become surrounded by an atmosphere of barely disguised acrimony; they stop being father, mother, sister or brother and become a purely negative factor in the struggle for life and, consequently, a source of bitterness for the healthy members of the community who resent their il ness as if it were a personal insult to those who have to support them. It is there, in the final moments, for people whose farthest horizon has always been tomorrow, that one comprehends the profound tragedy circumscribing the life of the proletariat  the  world  over.  In  those  dying  eyes  there  is  a  submissive  appeal  for  forgiveness  and also, often, a desperate plea for consolation which is lost to the void, just as their body wil  soon be lost  in  the  magnitude  of  the  mystery  surrounding  us.  How  long  this  present  order,  based  on  an absurd idea of caste, wil  last is not within my means to answer, but it’s time that those who govern spent less time publicizing their own virtues and more money, much more money, funding social y useful works.  \\n There  isn’t  much  I  can  do  for  the  sick  woman.  I  simply  advise  her  to  improve  her  diet  and prescribe a diuretic and some asthma pil s. I have a few Dramamine tablets left and I give them to her. When I leave, I am fol owed by the fawning words of the old woman and the family’s indifferent gaze.  \\n Alberto  had  tracked  down  the  doctors.  At  nine  the  fol owing  morning  we  had  to  be  at  the hospital.  Meanwhile,  in  La  Gioconda’s  filthy  room  which  serves  as  kitchen,  restaurant,  laundry, dining room and piss-house for cats and dogs, a miscel aneous col ection of people were meeting: the owner, with his basic life philosophy; Doña Carolina, a deaf and helpful old dear who left our  mate  kettle as good as new; a drunk, feeble-minded Mapuche* man who looked like a criminal; two more or less normal customers; and the queen of the gathering Doña Rosita, who was quite crazy.  \\n The conversation focused on a macabre event Rosita had witnessed; it appeared she alone had seen a man with a large knife stabbing her poor neighbor.  \\n “Was your neighbor screaming, Doña Rosita?”  \\n “Of  course  she  was  screaming,  who  wouldn’t!  He  was  skinning  her  alive!  That’s  not  al .  \\n Afterwards, he took her down to the sea and dragged her to the water’s edge so the sea would take her away. Oh, to hear that woman scream, señor, scared the living daylight out of me, you should have seen it!”  \\n “Why didn’t you tel  the police, Rosita?”  \\n “Oh, what for? Don’t you remember when your cousin was beat up? Wel , I went to report it and they told me I was crazy, that if I didn’t stop inventing things they’d lock me up, imagine that. No, I \\n wouldn’t tel  that lot anything!”  \\n The conversation turned to the “messenger from God,” a local man who uses the powers God has  given  him  to  cure  deafness,  dumbness,  paralysis,  etc.,  passing  the  col ection  plate  around afterwards.  The  business  seems  no  worse  than  any  other,  and  though  the  pamphlets  are extraordinary, so is people’s gul ibility. But that’s how it is, and they continued to make fun of the things Doña Rosita saw with al  the conviction in the world.  \\n The reception from the doctors wasn’t over-friendly, but we gained our objective: they gave us an  introduction  to  Molinas  Luco,  mayor  of  Valparaíso.  We  took  our  leave  with  al   the  required formality and went to the town hal . Our dazed and exhausted expressions didn’t impact favorably on the man at the desk, but he’d received orders to let us in.  \\n The  secretary  showed  us  a  copy  of  a  letter  written  in  response  to  ours,  explaining  that  our project  was  impossible  since  the  only  ship  to  Easter  Island  had  left  and  that  there  wouldn’t  be another  ship  leaving  within  the  year.  We  were  ushered  into  the  sumptuous  office  of  Dr.  Molinas Luco, who received us amicably. He gave the impression, however, of acting out a scene in a play, taking a lot of care to pronounce each word perfectly. He became enthusiastic only when talking about  Easter  Island,  which  he  had  wrested  from  the  English  by  proving  it  belonged  to  Chile.  He recommended we keep up with events and said he would take us the fol owing year. “I may not be in this office, but I am stil  president of the Friends of Easter Island Society,” he said, a tacit confession of González Videla’s impending electoral defeat. As we left, the man at the desk told us to take our dog with us, and to our amazement showed us a puppy that had done its business on the lobby carpet and was gnawing at a chair leg. The dog had probably fol owed us, attracted by our hobo appearance,  and  the  doorman  imagined  it  was  just  another  accessory  of  our  eccentric  attire.  \\n Anyway, the poor animal, robbed of the bond linking him to us, got a good kick up the ass and was thrown  out  howling.  Stil ,  it  was  always  consoling  to  know  that  some  living  thing’s  wel -being depended on our protection.  \\n By this time we were determined that traveling by sea we could avoid the desert in northern Chile, and we fronted up to the shipping companies requesting free passage to any of the northern ports.  The  captain  at  one  of  them  promised  to  take  us  if  we  could  arrange  permission  from  the maritime  authorities  to  work  for  our  passage.  The  reply,  of  course,  was  negative  and  we  found ourselves  back  at  square  one.  In  that  split  second, Alberto  made  a  heroic  decision,  which  went something like this: we would sneak on to the boat and hide away in the hold. For our best chance we would have to wait until nightfal , try to persuade the sailor on duty and see what would happen.  \\n We  col ected  our  things,  evidently  far  too  many  for  this  particular  plan.  With  great  regret  we farewel ed  al   our  friends  and  afterwards  crossed  through  the  main  gates  of  the  port;  burning  our bridges, we set off on our maritime adventure.  \\n \\n *Mapuches are an indigenous people of Chile.  \\n \\n POLIZONES \\n stowaways \\n \\n We  passed  through  customs  without  any  difficulties  and  bravely  headed  toward  our  target.  The chosen boat, the   San Antonio , was at the center of the port’s feverish activity. Because of its smal size  it  didn’t  have  to  come  right  up  alongside  for  the  cranes  to  reach  it  and  there  was  a  gap  of several meters between it and the docks. We had no choice but to wait until the boat moved closer before  boarding,  and  so,  philosophical y,  we  sat  down  on  our  bags  to  wait  for  the  propitious moment. With the midnight change of shift the boat was brought alongside, but the harbormaster, a nasty character whose face disclosed his il  temper, stood squarely on the gangplank checking the arriving and departing workers. The crane driver, who in the meantime we had befriended, advised us to wait for a better moment because, he said, the master was a hostile bastard. So we began a long wait which lasted the whole night, warming ourselves in the crane, an ancient contraption that ran on steam. The sun rose to see us stil  waiting on the dock with our bags. Our hopes of boarding by  stealth  had  almost  completely  dissipated  when  the  captain  turned  up  with  a  new,  restored gangplank, and with it the   San Antonio  was now in permanent contact with dry land. Wel -instructed by the crane driver, we slipped on board easily, making ourselves at home, and locked ourselves and our bags in the bathroom of the officers’ quarters. From then on, al  we had to do was say in a nasal  little  voice  “excuse  me,  can’t  come  in”  or  “it’s  occupied,”  on  the  half  dozen  or  so  times someone tried to open the door.  \\n Twelve  p.m.  came  fast  and  the  boat  sailed,  but  our  joy  was  fast  disappearing  because  the toilet, apparently blocked for some time, gave off an insufferable smel  and the heat was intense. By 1 p.m., Alberto had vomited up everything that had been in his stomach, and by 5 p.m., dying of hunger and with the coast long out of sight, we presented ourselves to the captain as stowaways.  \\n He was surprised to see us again and in these particular circumstances, but to conceal his surprise in front of the other officers, he winked at us flamboyantly while asking in a thundering voice: “Do you two seriously believe that to go traveling the only thing you have to do is hide away in the first boat you find? Have you not thought through the consequences of doing exactly that?”  \\n The truth is we hadn’t thought through a thing.  \\n He cal ed the steward and charged him to give us work and something to eat. We devoured \\n \\n our  rations  contentedly,  but  when  I  learned  that  I  would  have  to  clean  the  famous  toilet,  the  food caught in my throat. As I went below, swearing behind closed lips and fol owed by Alberto’s amused glance, who was assigned to peel potatoes, I confess I felt tempted to forget everything ever written about the rules of friendship and request a change of jobs. There is no justice! He adds a good portion to the accumulated filth and I clean it up!  \\n After conscientiously completing our work, the captain summoned us again. He recommended that we say nothing about our previous meeting and that he would ensure nothing happened when we arrived in Antofagasta, the ship’s destination. He let us sleep in the cabin of an officer on leave, and that night invited us to play canasta and have a drink or two. After a rejuvenating sleep we got up, participating with ful  consent in the phrase, “New brooms sweep cleanly.” We set to work with great diligence, determined to earn the price of our passage, with interest. By midday, however, we felt we were overdoing it and by the afternoon we became firmly convinced we were the purest pair of  bums  around.  We  thought  we  should  get  a  good  sleep,  ready  for  work  the  next  day,  not  to mention washing our dirty clothes, but the captain again invited us to play cards and that kil ed our good intentions.  \\n It took the steward, sufficiently unfriendly, approximately one hour to get us up to begin working.  \\n My  job  was  to  clean  the  decks  with  kerosene,  a  task  I  worked  at  al   day  and  stil   didn’t  finish.  \\n Alberto’s string-pul ing found him back in the kitchen, eating better food and more of it, not being too discriminating about what he was pouring into his stomach.  \\n At night, after the exhausting games of canasta, we would look out over the immense sea, ful of white-flecked and green reflections, the two of us leaning side by side on the railing, each of us far  away,  flying  in  his  own  aircraft  to  the  stratospheric  regions  of  his  own  dreams.  There  we understood that our vocation, our true vocation, was to move for eternity along the roads and seas of the world. Always curious, looking into everything that came before our eyes, sniffing out each corner but only ever faintly — not setting down roots in any land or staying long enough to see the substratum of things; the outer limits would suffice. As al  the sentimental themes the sea inspires passed through our conversation, the lights of Antofagasta began to shine in the distance, to the northeast. It was the end of our adventure as stowaways, or at least the end of this adventure now that our boat was returning to Valparaíso.  \\n ESTA VEZ, FRACASO \\n this time, disaster \\n   \\n I  can  see  him  now  clearly,  the  drunk  captain,  like  al   his  officers  and  the  owner  of  the  vessel alongside with his great big mustache, their crude gestures the results of bad wine. And the wild laughter as they recounted our odyssey. “Hey listen, they’re tigers, they’re on your boat now for sure, you’l  find out when you’re out to sea.” The captain must have let slip to his friend and col eague this or some similar phrase.  \\n We didn’t, of course, know any of this; an hour before sailing we were comfortably instal ed, total y buried in tons of perfumed melons, stuffing ourselves sil y. We were talking about the sailors, who were the best, since with the complicity of one of them we had been able to get on board and hide  ourselves  away  in  such  a  secure  spot. And  then  we  heard  an  irate  voice,  and  a  seemingly enormous mustache emerged from who knows where and plunged us into an appal ing confusion. A long line of melon skins, perfectly peeled, was floating away Indian file on the tranquil sea. The rest was ignominious. The sailor told us afterwards, “I’d have got him off the scent, boys, but he saw the melons and it seems he went into a “batten down the hatches, don’t let anyone escape” routine. And wel ,” (he was fairly embarrassed) “you shouldn’t have eaten so many melons!”  \\n One of our traveling companions from the   San Antonio  summed up his bril iant life philosophy with one fine phrase: “Stop arsing about you assholes. Why don’t you get off your asses and go back to your asshole country.” So that’s more or less what we did; we picked up our bags and set off for Chuquicamata, the famous copper mine.  \\n But not straight away. There was a pause of one day while we waited for permission from the mine’s authorities to visit and meanwhile we received an appropriate send-off from the enthusiastic Bacchanalian sailors.  \\n Lying beneath the meager shade of two lampposts on the arid road leading to the mines, we spent a good part of the day yel ing things at each other now and again from one post to another, until on the horizon appeared the asthmatic outline of the little truck which took us halfway, to a town cal ed Baquedano.  \\n There we made friends with a married couple, Chilean workers who were communists.* By the light of the single candle il uminating us, drinking   mate  and eating a piece of bread and cheese, the man’s  shrunken  figure  carried  a  mysterious,  tragic  air.  In  his  simple,  expressive  language  he recounted  his  three  months  in  prison,  and  told  us  about  his  starving  wife  who  stood  by  him  with exemplary loyalty, his children left in the care of a kindly neighbor, his fruitless pilgrimage in search of work and his   compañeros , mysteriously disappeared and said to be somewhere at the bottom of the sea.  \\n The  couple,  numb  with  cold,  huddling  against  each  other  in  the  desert  night,  were  a  living representation of the proletariat in any part of the world. They had not one single miserable blanket to cover themselves with, so we gave them one of ours and Alberto and I wrapped the other around us as best we could. It was one of the coldest times in my life, but also one which made me feel a \\n little more brotherly toward this strange, for me at least, human species.  \\n At  eight  the  next  morning  we  found  a  truck  to  take  us  to  the  town  of  Chuquicamata.  We separated  from  the  couple  who  were  heading  for  the  sulphur  mines  in  the  mountains  where  the climate is so bad and the living conditions so hard that you don’t need a work permit and nobody asks you what your politics are. The only thing that matters is the enthusiasm with which the workers set to ruining their health in search of a few meager crumbs that barely provide their subsistence.  \\n Although the blurred silhouette of the couple was nearly lost in the distance separating us, we could  stil   see  the  man’s  singularly  determined  face  and  we  remembered  his  straightforward invitation: “Come, comrades, let’s eat together. I, too, am a tramp,” showing his underlying disdain for the parasitic nature he saw in our aimless traveling.  \\n It’s  a  great  pity  that  they  repress  people  like  this.  Apart  from  whether  col ectivism,  the \\n “communist vermin,” is a danger to decent life, the communism gnawing at his entrails was no more than a natural longing for something better, a protest against persistent hunger transformed into a love for this strange doctrine, whose essence he could never grasp but whose translation, “bread for the poor,” was something which he understood and, more importantly, fil ed him with hope.  \\n Once  there,  the  bosses,  the  blond,  efficient  and  arrogant  managers,  told  us  in  primitive Spanish:  “This  isn’t  a  tourist  town.  I’l   find  a  guide  to  give  you  a  half-hour  tour  around  the  mine’s instal ations and then do us a favor and leave us alone, we have a lot of work to do.” A strike was imminent.  Yet  the  guide,  faithful  dog  of  the  Yankee  bosses,  told  us:  “Imbecilic  gringos,  losing thousands  of   pesos   every  day  in  a  strike  so  as  not  to  give  a  poor  worker  a  few  more   centavos .  \\n When my General Ibáñez comes to power that’l  al  be over.”* And a foreman-poet: “These are the famous  terraces  that  enable  every  inch  of  copper  to  be  mined.  Many  people  like  you  ask  me technical questions but it is rare they ask how many lives it has cost. I can’t answer you, doctors, but thank you for asking.”  \\n Cold efficiency and impotent resentment go hand in hand in the big mine, linked in spite of the hatred by the common necessity to live, on the one hand, and to speculate on the other… we wil see whether one day, some miner wil  take up his pick in pleasure and go and poison his lungs with a conscious joy. They say that’s what it’s like over there, where the red blaze that now lights up the world comes from. So they say. I don’t know.  \\n \\n *The Chilean Communist Party was banned and many members persecuted under the so-called Law for the Defense of Democracy (1948–58).  \\n *Carlos  Ibáñez  del  Campo  was  Chilean  President  from  1952  to  1958.  He  was  a  populist,  who  promised  to  legalize  the Communist Party if elected.  \\n \\n CHUQUICAMATA \\n chuquicamata \\n \\n Chuquicamata is like a scene from a modern drama. You cannot say that it’s lacking in beauty, but it is  a  beauty  without  grace,  imposing  and  glacial. As  you  come  close  to  any  part  of  the  mine,  the whole landscape seems to concentrate, giving a feeling of suffocation across the plain. There is a moment when, after 200 kilometers, the lightly shaded green of the little town of Calama interrupts the  monotonous  gray  and  is  greeted  with  the  joy  which  an  authentic  oasis  in  the  desert  richly deserves. And what a desert! The weather observatory at Moctezuma, near “Chuqui,” describes it as the driest in the world. The mountains, where not a single blade of grass can grow in the nitrate soil, are defenseless against attacks of wind and water. They display their gray spine, prematurely aged  in  the  battle  with  the  elements,  and  their  wrinkles  that  do  not  correspond  to  their  true geological age. And how many of those mountains surrounding their famous brother enclose in their heavy entrails similar riches, as they wait for the soul ess arms of the mechanical shovels to devour their  insides,  spiced  as  they  would  be  with  the  inevitable  human  lives  —  the  lives  of  the  poor, unsung heroes of this battle, who die miserably in one of the thousand traps set by nature to defend its treasures, when al  they want is to earn their daily bread.  \\n Chuquicamata is essential y a great copper mountain with 20-meter-high terraces cut into its enormous  sides,  from  where  the  extracted  mineral  is  easily  transported  by  rail.  The  unique formation of the vein means that extraction is entirely open cut, al owing large-scale exploitation of the  ore  body,  which  grades  one  percent  copper  per  ton  of  ore.  Every  morning  the  mountain  is dynamited  and  huge  mechanical  shovels  load  the  material  on  to  rail  wagons  that  take  it  to  the grinder to be crushed. This crushing occurs over three consecutive passes, turning the raw material into a medium-fine gravel. It is then put in a sulphuric acid solution which extracts the copper in the form of a sulphate, also forming a copper chloride, which becomes ferrous chloride when it comes into contact with old iron. From there the liquid is taken to the so-cal ed “green house” where the copper sulphate solution is put into huge baths and for a week submitted to a current of 30 volts, bringing about the electrolysis of the salt: the copper sticks to the thin sheets of the same metal, which have previously been formed in other baths with stronger solutions. After five or six days, the sheets are ready for the smelter; the solution has lost eight to 10 grams of sulphate per liter and is enriched with new quantities of the ground material. The sheets are then placed in furnaces that,  \\n \\n after  12  hours  smelting  at  2,000  degrees  centigrade,  produce  350-pound  ingots.  Every  night  45 \\n wagons in convoy take over 20 tons of copper each down to Antofagasta, the result of the day’s work.  \\n This is a crude summary of the manufacturing process, which employs a floating population of 3,000  souls  in  Chuquicamata;  but  this  process  only  extracts  oxide  ore.  The  Chile  Exploration Company is building another plant to exploit the sulphate ore. This plant, the biggest of its kind in the world, has two 96-meter-high chimneys and wil  take over almost al  future production, while the old  plant  wil   be  slowly  phased  out  since  the  oxide  ore  is  about  to  run  out.  There  is  already  an enormous  stockpile  of  raw  material  to  feed  the  new  smelter  and  it  wil   begin  to  be  processed  in 1954 when the plant is opened.  \\n Chile  produces  20  percent  of  the  world’s  copper,  and  in  these  uncertain  times  of  potential conflict copper has become vital y important because it is an essential component of various types of  weapons  of  destruction.  Hence,  an  economic  and  political  battle  is  being  waged  in  Chile between a coalition of nationalist and left-wing groupings that advocate nationalizing the mines, and those who, in the cause of free enterprise, prefer a wel -run mine (even in foreign hands) to possibly less efficient management by the state. Serious accusations have been made in congress against the  companies  currently  exploiting  the  concessions,  symptomatic  of  the  climate  of  nationalist aspiration surrounding copper production.  \\n Whatever the outcome of the battle, one would do wel  not to forget the lesson taught by the graveyards of the mines, containing only a smal  share of the immense number of people devoured by cave-ins, silica and the hel ish climate of the mountain.  \\n KILOMETRAJE ÁRIDO \\n arid land for miles and miles \\n \\n Now that we’d lost our water bottle, the problem of crossing the desert by foot became even worse.  \\n Stil , without apprehension we set off, leaving behind the barrier marking the limits of the town of Chuquicamata. Our pace was incredibly athletic while within sight of the town’s inhabitants, but later the  vast  solitude  of  the  bare  Andes,  the  sun  that  fel   harshly  across  our  necks  and  the  badly distributed  weight  of  our  backpacks  brought  us  back  to  reality.  Until  what  point  our  actions  were \\n “heroic,” as one policeman put it, we’re not sure, but we began to suspect, I think with good reason, that the definitive adjective was approximating something more like “stupid.”  \\n After two hours’ walking, 10 kilometers at the most, we planted ourselves down in the shade of a sign saying I’ve no idea what, the only thing capable of offering us the slightest shelter from the rays of the sun. And there we stayed al  day, shifting around to get the post’s shade in our eyes at least.  \\n We  rapidly  consumed  the  liter  of  water  we  had  brought  with  us  and  by  late  afternoon,  with gargantuan thirst, we set off back toward the sentry post at the town’s limits, total y defeated.  \\n We spent the night there, seeking refuge inside the little room, where a bright fire maintained the  pleasant  temperature  despite  the  cold  outside.  The  nightwatchman,  with  proverbial  Chilean hospitality,  shared  his  food  with  us,  a  pathetic  feast  after  a  whole  day  of  fasting,  but  better  than nothing.  \\n At  dawn  the  next  day  the  truck  of  a  cigarette  company  passed  and  took  us  closer  to  our destination;  but  while  continuing  directly  on  to  the  port  of  Tocopil a,  we  were  thinking  of  heading north to Ilave, so it dropped us where the roads crossed. We started walking enthusiastical y toward a house we knew was eight kilometers up the road, but only halfway there we became tired and resolved to have a little nap. We hung one of our blankets between a telegraph post and a distance marker and got under it — a Turkish bath for our bodies and a sunbath for our feet.  \\n Two or three hours later, when we’d lost about three liters of water each, a smal  Ford passed by  containing  three  noble  citizens,  al   roaring  drunk  and  singing   cuecas*   at  ful   blast.  They  were striking workers from the mine cal ed Magdalena, celebrating the victory of the people’s cause a little prematurely by getting happily plastered. The drunks took us as far as a local railroad station.  \\n There we encountered a group of laborers practising for a footbal  match with a rival team. Alberto took  a  pair  of  running  shoes  out  of  his  backpack  and  started  to  sound  off.  The  result  was spectacular. We were signed up for the match on the fol owing Sunday; in return: food, board and transport to Iquique.  \\n Two days later Sunday arrived, marked by a splendid victory for our team and a barbecue of goat prepared by Alberto, astounding the assembled gathering with the art of Argentine cooking.  \\n Those two days we dedicated to visiting some of the many nitrate-purifying plants in that area of Chile.  \\n It real y isn’t very difficult for mining companies to extract the mineral wealth of this part of the world.  There’s  nothing  more  to  do  besides  scraping  off  the  top  layer  containing  the  mineral  and transporting it to huge baths where it’s submitted to a fairly uncomplicated separating process to extract the nitrates, saltpeter and mud. Apparently the Germans had the first concessions but their plants were expropriated and they are now largely British-owned. Workers at the two biggest mines in terms of both production and workforce were at the time on strike and the mines were south of where we were heading, so we decided not to visit them. We went instead to quite a big plant, La Victoria, which has at its entrance a plaque marking the place where Hector Supicci Sedes died, the bril iant Uruguayan ral y driver who was hit by another driver as he came out of a refuel ing pit \\n \\n stop.  \\n A  succession  of  trucks  took  us  al   over  the  region  until  we  final y  reached  Iquique  warmly wrapped in blankets of alfalfa, the cargo of the truck that took us the last leg. Our arrival, with the sun rising  behind  us,  casting  our  reflections  against  the  purest  blue  of  the  morning  sea,  seemed  like something  out  of   A Thousand and One Nights . As if it were a magic carpet the truck appeared, fluttering on the cliff faces above the port, and as first gear slowed our winding and groaning flight downward we saw from our vantage point the whole city rising to meet us.  \\n In Iquique there wasn’t a single boat, Argentine or any other kind, so it was useless staying in the port and we decided to scrounge a lift on the first truck leaving for Arica.  \\n \\n *Chilean folksongs.  \\n ACABA CHILE \\n the end of chile \\n \\n The long kilometers stretching between Iquique and Arica climb and descend the whole way. We were carried from arid tablelands to val eys with only slight trickles of water running through them, barely sufficient for a few smal , stunted trees to grow at their edges. These utterly desolate   pampas  emit a sultry heat during the day, though as with al  desert climates it is considerably cooler by night.  \\n The  thought  that  Valdivia  came  through  this  way  with  his  handful  of  men,  traveling  50  or  60 \\n kilometers a day without discovering a drop of water or even some shrub to shelter from the hottest hours, leaves a strong impression. Knowledge of the terrain actual y crossed by the conquistadors automatical y  elevates  Valdivia’s  feat  to  one  of  the  most  notable  of  Spanish  colonization,  without doubt superior to the those that endure in the history of America because more fortunate explorers found wealthy kingdoms at the end of their adventurous wars, turning the sweat of their conquest into gold.  \\n Valdivia’s actions symbolize man’s indefatigable thirst to take control of a place where he can exercise total authority. That phrase, attributed to Caesar, proclaiming he would rather be first-in-command  in  some  humble  Alpine  vil age  than  second-in-command  in  Rome,  is  repeated  less pompously,  but  no  less  effectively,  in  the  epic  campaign  that  is  the  conquest  of  Chile.  If,  in  the moment the conquistador was facing death at the hands of that invincible Araucanian Caupolicán,  \\n \\n he  had  not  been  overwhelmed  with  fury,  like  a  hunted  animal,  I  do  not  doubt  that  judging  his  life, Valdivia would have felt his death was ful y justified. He belonged to that special class of men the species  produces  every  so  often,  in  whom  a  craving  for  limitless  power  is  so  extreme  that  any suffering to achieve it seems natural, and he had become the omnipotent ruler of a warrior nation.  \\n Arica  is  a  sweet  little  port  which  hasn’t  yet  lost  the  memory  of  its  previous  owners,  the Peruvians, and it forms a kind of meeting point between the two countries, so different in spite of their geographical proximity and common ancestry. The promontory, pride of the town, rises 100 \\n meters in an imposing mass of sheer rock face. The palm trees, the heat, the subtropical fruit sold in  the  markets,  al   lend  it  the  unique  physiognomy  of  a  Caribbean  town,  or  something  like  that, completely different from its peers further south.  \\n A doctor, who showed us as much disrespect as an established, financial y secure bourgeois can show to a couple of hobos (even hobos with titles), permitted us to sleep in the town’s hospital.  \\n Early the next day we fled the unwelcoming place, heading straight for the border with Peru. But first we bade farewel  to the Pacific with one last swim (soap and everything) and it served to awaken a dormant  yearning  in  Alberto:  to  eat  seafood.  We  began  a  patient  search  for  clams  and  other seafood on the beach by some cliffs. We ate something salty and slimy, but it didn’t distract us from our hunger or satisfy Alberto’s craving, in fact it wouldn’t even have made a prisoner happy. The slime was repulsive and, with nothing to season it, worse.  \\n We set off at our usual time, after eating at the police station, marking out our track along the coast until the border. A van, however, picked us up and we reached the border post instal ed in comfort. We met a customs officer who had worked on the Argentine border, and acknowledging and appreciating our passion for   mate  he gave us hot water, cookies and, best of al , found us a ride to Tacna. The police chief welcomed us amiably at the border with several pretentious inanities about Argentines in Peru and with a handshake, we said goodbye to that hospitable Chilean land.  \\n CHILE, OJEADA DE LEJOS \\n chile, a vision from afar \\n \\n When  I  made  these  travel  notes,  hot  and  fresh  with  enthusiasm,  I  wrote  some  things  that  were perhaps a little flashy and somewhat removed from the intended spirit of scientific inquiry. And it’s probably not appropriate now, more than a year after writing them, to give my current opinions about \\n Chile; I’d prefer to review what I wrote then.  \\n Beginning with our area of expertise, medicine: the panorama of health care in Chile leaves a lot to be desired (although I realized later it was by far superior to that in other countries I got to know). Free, public hospitals are extremely rare and even in those, posters announcing the fol owing appear: “Why do you complain about your treatment if you are not contributing to the maintenance of this  hospital?”  General y  speaking,  medical  attention  in  the  north  is  free,  but  hospital accommodation  has  to  be  paid  for,  and  prices  range  from  petty  sums  to  virtual  monuments  to legalized  theft.  Sick  or  injured  workers  at  the  Chuquicamata  mine  receive  medical  attention  and hospital treatment for five Chilean   escudos  a day, but someone not working at the mine would pay between  300  and  500   escudos   a  day.  Hospitals  have  no  money  and  they  lack  medicine  and adequate facilities. We have seen filthy operating rooms with pitiful lighting, not just in smal  towns but  even  in  Valparaíso.  There  aren’t  enough  surgical  instruments.  The  bathrooms  are  dirty.  \\n Awareness  of  hygiene  is  poor.  It’s  a  Chilean  custom  (afterwards  I  saw  it  across  practical y  al   of South  America)  not  to  throw  used  toilet  paper  in  the  toilet  but  on  to  the  floor  or  in  the  boxes provided.  \\n The standard of living in Chile is lower than in Argentina. On top of the very low wages paid in the south, unemployment is high and the authorities afford workers very little protection (although it’s better than what is provided in the north of the continent). Veritable waves of Chileans are driven by al  this into emigrating to Argentina, in search of the legendary city of gold which cunning political propaganda has offered those who live to the west of the Andes. In the north, workers in the copper, nitrate, gold and sulphur mines are better paid, but life is much more expensive, and in general they lack  many  essential  consumer  items  and  the  mountain  climate  is  cruel.  It  brings  to  mind  the meaningful  shrug  with  which  a  manager  at  Chuquicamata  answered  my  questions  regarding compensation paid to the families of the 10,000 or more workers interred in the local cemetery.  \\n The  political  scene  is  confusing  (this  was  written  before  the  elections  in  which  Ibáñez triumphed). There are four presidential candidates, of whom Carlos Ibáñez del Campo seems most likely to win. A retired soldier with dictatorial tendencies and political ambitions similar to those of Perón, he inspires his people with al  the enthusiasm of a caudil o. His base of power is the Popular Socialist Party, behind which various minor factions are united. Second in line, as far as I can see, is  Pedro  Enrique  Alfonso,  the  official  government  candidate,  who  is  political y  ambiguous;  he seems to be friendly with the Americans and courts almost al  the other parties. The champion of the right is the tycoon Arturo Matte Larraín, the son-in-law of the late President Alessandri who enjoys the  support  of  al   the  reactionary  sectors  of  the  population.  Last  on  the  list  is  the  Popular  Front candidate Salvador Al ende,* who is supported by the communists even though they have seen their voting power reduced by 40,000, the number of people denied the right to vote because of their affiliation to the Communist Party.  \\n It’s likely that Ibáñez wil  observe a politics of Latin Americanism, manipulating hatred for the \\n \\n United States to gain popularity; nationalizing the copper mines and others (although the fact that the United States owns huge Peruvian mineral deposits and is practical y ready to begin exploiting them  doesn’t  greatly  increase  my  confidence  that  nationalization  of  these  Chilean  mines  wil   be feasible,  at  least  in  the  short  term);  continue  nationalizing  the  railroads  and  substantial y  enlarge Argentine–Chilean trade.  \\n Chile as a nation offers economic promise to any person disposed to work for it, so long as they  don’t  belong  to  the  proletariat:  that  is,  anyone  who  has  a  certain  dose  of  education  and technical knowledge. The land has the capacity to sustain enough livestock (especial y sheep) and cereals to provide for its population. There are the necessary mineral resources to transform it into a  powerful  industrial  country:  iron,  copper,  coal,  tin,  gold,  silver,  manganese  and  nitrates.  The biggest effort Chile should make is to shake its uncomfortable Yankee friend from its back, a task that  for  the  moment  at  least  is  Herculean,  given  the  quantity  of  dol ars  the  United  States  has invested  and  the  ease  with  which  it  flexes  its  economic  muscle  whenever  its  interests  appear threatened.  \\n \\n *In  1970, Allende  was  elected  as  Chilean  President.  In  1973,  a  U.S.-backed  coup  installed  General Augusto  Pinochet’s dictatorship, which lasted 17 years.  \\n TARATA, EL MUNDO NUEVO \\n tarata, the new world \\n \\n Scarcely a few meters separated us from the Civil Guard post marking the limits of the town, but already our backpacks felt a hundred times heavier than they were. The sun stung us but as always we were wrapped in too many clothes for the hour of the day, though later we’d get very cold. The road climbed quickly and in no time we had passed the pyramid we’d seen from the vil age, built in homage to those Peruvians who died in the war with Chile.* We decided it would be a good place to make our first stop and test our luck with the passing trucks. Al  we could see in the direction of the road was a barren hil side, with barely any vegetation; placid Tacna, with its little dirt streets and terracotta  roofs,  waited  so  far  in  the  distance  it  seemed  almost  daunting.  The  first  truck  to  pass caused  us  great  turmoil;  we  stuck  our  thumbs  out  apprehensively  and  to  our  surprise  the  driver stopped just ahead of us. Alberto took command of the operation, explaining in words that by now were  very  familiar  to  me  the  purpose  of  our  journey  and  asking  him  for  a  lift;  the  driver  gave  an \\n affirmative nod, indicating we should climb in the back, with a whole band of Indians.  \\n Col ecting our bags and crazy with gratitude, we were about to climb up when he cal ed out to us: “Five   soles  to Tarata, you know that, right?” Alberto, furious, asked why he’d said nothing earlier, when we’d asked to be taken free of charge. The driver wasn’t sure exactly what “free of charge”  \\n meant, but to Tarata it was five   soles… \\n “And every one of them wil  be like that,” Alberto said angrily, in that simple phrase directing al of his frustration toward me, who had suggested the idea in the first place of walking out of town to hitch a lift, rather than wait there like he wanted to do. The moment became decisive. We could go back, in which case we’d be admitting defeat, or we could continue on foot, letting whatever would happen, happen. We decided on the second course and started walking. It soon became apparent that our choice was not altogether wise: the sun was about to set and al  around there was a total absence of life. Stil , we supposed that so close to the vil age there would be some shack or other and, sustained by this il usion, we carried on.  \\n It was soon pitch dark and we hadn’t encountered a single sign of habitation. Even worse, we had  no  water  with  which  to  cook  or  brew   mate .  The  cold  intensified;  the  desert  climate  and  the altitude we had reached turned the screw. Our exhaustion was unbelievable. We resolved simply to lay out our blankets over the ground and sleep until dawn. There was no moon, and the night was very dark, so we felt our way around spreading our blankets and wraped ourselves up as wel  as we could.  \\n After five minutes Alberto informed me he was frozen solid; I responded that my poor body was even colder. But this wasn’t a competition in refrigeration, so we decided to tackle the situation and search for some twigs to make a smal  fire and to occupy our hands. The result was unsurprisingly pathetic.  Between  us  we  managed  a  handful  of  sticks,  making  a  timid  fire  incapable  of  heating anything at al . The hunger was grating but the cold much more so, to the point where we could no longer lie there just watching the four embers of our fire. We had to pack up camp and walk on in the dark. At first, to get warm, we set a fast pace and in no time we were desperate for breath. Under my jacket I felt the sweat running off me, but my feet were numb with cold and the sharp wind cut our faces like a knife. After two hours we were exhausted and my watch said only 12:30 a.m. A hopeful estimate  gave  us  at  least  five  hours  of  night  to  go.  Further  debate  and  another  shot  at  sleeping between our blankets. After five minutes we were on our way again. The night was stil  young when we saw head lights in the distance; it wasn’t something to get too excited about — the chances of getting a ride were bad — but at least the road was lit up. And that’s how it went, the truck passed us by, indifferent in the face of our frantic shouts, and its lights exposed a deserted wasteland; no trees,  no  houses.  Then  confusion  descended,  every  minute  was  slower  than  the  one  before  until eventual y the minutes became hours. Two or three times a distant dog’s bark gave us some hope, but the pitch black night disclosed nothing and the dogs fel  silent or moved off in other directions.  \\n At six in the morning we saw two huts by the edge of the road, il uminated in the clear, gray light \\n of dawn. The last few meters we traveled in a flash, as if we had no weight at al  on our backs. It seemed that we had never been welcomed with such friendliness, that we had never eaten bread and cheese like they sold us, or had such revitalizing   mate . We were like demigods to these simple people: Alberto brandished his doctor’s certificate for them, and moreover we had come from that wonderful country Argentina, where Perón lived with his wife Evita, where the poor have as much as the rich and the Indian isn’t exploited or treated as severely as he is in this country. We answered thousands  of  questions  about  our  country  and  its  way  of  life.  With  the  night  chil   stil   deeply embedded in our bones, our rose-colored imagery transformed Argentina into an al uring vision of the past. Our spirits lifted by the timid kindness of the   cholos ,* we made for a nearby dry riverbed, in which we spread our blankets and slept, caressed by the rising sun.  \\n At  12  we  set  off  again,  much  happier,  the  previous  night’s  suffering  forgotten,  fol owing  old Vizcacha’s advice.** The road was long though and we were soon pausing with notable frequency.  \\n We stopped for a rest at five in the afternoon, apathetical y observing the approaching outline of a truck. As usual it was transporting a cargo of human livestock, the most profitable business of al  in that  area.  But  to  our  surprise,  the  truck  stopped  and  we  saw  the  Civil  Guard  from  Tacna  waving happily to us and inviting us to climb on; the invitation, of course, did not need to be repeated. The Aymara Indians in the back looked at us curiously but didn’t dare ask anything. Alberto tried to start a  conversation  with  some  of  them,  though  their  Spanish  was  bad.  The  truck  continued  to  climb through  an  absolutely  desolate  landscape  where  only  a  few  struggling  thorn  bushes  gave  any appearance of being alive. Then, suddenly, the grumbling with which the truck made its way higher gave way to a sigh of relief as we leveled out on to the plateau. We entered the town of Estaque and the  view  was  incredible;  our  ecstatic  eyes  fixed  themselves  momentarily  on  the  landscape extending around us and then we had to find out the names and explanations for al  the things we saw.  The  Aymaras  could  barely  understand  us  but  the  few  indications  they  gave,  in  confused Spanish, only increased the emotional impact of the surroundings. We were in a legendary val ey, whose  evolution  had  been  suspended  several  hundred  years  ago,  and  we  happy  20th-century mortals had today been given the good fortune to see it. The irrigation channels — built by the Incas for the wel -being of their subjects — flowed from the mountain into the val ey, forming a thousand little waterfal s and running back and forth across the road as it spiral ed down. Ahead of us, low clouds hid the tops of the mountains, but in some of the clear spaces you could just make out snow fal ing  on  the  highest  peaks,  gradual y  turning  them  white.  The  different  crops  cultivated  by  the Indians, careful y grown in terraced beds, al owed us to penetrate a new realm of botanical science:  oca, quinua, canihua, rocoto , maize. We saw people wearing the same dress as the Indians in the truck, in their natural surroundings. They wore short, sadly colored wool en ponchos, tight calf-length pants, and sandals made from rope or old car tires. Absorbing everything we saw, we continued down the val ey to Tarata. In the Aymara language this means the apex, or place of confluence, and it’s been wel  named since it stands within a great V formed by the mountain chains that are the town’s guardians. It is an ancient, gentle vil age where life continues on the course it has traveled for \\n \\n centuries. The colonial church must be an archaeological gem because, even more than its age, it marks the union of imported European art with the spirit of the local Indians. In the narrow lanes of the town, its hugely uneven streets paved in local stone, the Indian women with their children on their backs…  in  short,  in  every  typical  scene,  the  town’s  very  breath  evokes  the  time  before  Spanish colonization. But the people before us are not the same proud race that repeatedly rose up against Inca rule, forcing them to maintain a permanent army on their borders; these people who watch us walk through the streets of the town are a defeated race. Their stares are tame, almost fearful, and completely indifferent to the outside world. Some give the impression they go on living only because it’s  a  habit  they  cannot  shake.  The  Civil  Guard  took  us  to  the  police  station  where  they  gave  us board  and  some  of  the  officers  invited  us  to  eat.  We  walked  around  town  and  then  rested  for  a while, since at three in the morning we were heading off to Puno on a passenger truck. Thanks to the Civil Guard, we were traveling for free.  \\n \\n *Chile annexed the mineral-rich Atacarna desert in the so-called “Nitrate Wars” of 1879–83.  \\n *Indians or mestizos.  \\n **A character from “Martín Fierro,” an epic poem of gaucho life by the Argentine José Hernández.  \\n EN LOS DOMINIOS DE LA PACHAMAMA \\n in the dominions of pachamama \\n \\n By three in the morning, the blankets of the Peruvian police had demonstrated their value, swathing us  in  restorative  warmth.  The  policeman  on  guard  then  shook  us  awake  —  there  was  a  truck heading for Ilave — and we found ourselves in the sad situation of having to leave them behind. The night was magnificent, if terribly cold, and we were granted the privilege of some planks to sit on, separating us from the foul-smel ing, flea-ridden human flock below us, their potent but warm stink a virtual lasso. Only as the vehicle began its ascent did we realize the magnitude of the concession: nothing of the smel  came close and it would have been difficult for a single, athletic flea to spring on to us for refuge. The wind lashed liberal y against our bodies, however, and within minutes we were literal y frozen. The truck continued to climb and with every minute the cold became more intense.  \\n To stop ourselves fal ing off we had to keep our hands outside the more or less protective blankets; it was difficult to shift position even slightly without coming close to head-first flight into the back of \\n the truck. Close to dawn, some carburetor problem which afflicts engines at this altitude caused the truck to stop; we were nearing the highest point of the road, almost 5,000 meters. In some corners of the sky the sun was rising and a vague light replaced the total darkness accompanying us until then. The psychological effect of the sun is strange: it had not yet appeared over the horizon and we already felt comforted, just imagining the heat it would bring.  \\n On one side of the road huge, semi-spherical fungi were growing — the only vegetation in the region — and we used them to make a pathetic fire which served to heat water from a little bit of snow.  The  spectacle  offered  by  the  two  of  us  drinking  our  strange  brew  must  have  seemed  as interesting to the Indians as their traditional dress seemed to us, because not a moment passed without one of them approaching to ask in broken Spanish just why we were pouring water into that strange artefact. The truck categorical y refused to take us any further, so al  of us had to walk about three kilometers in the snow. It was remarkable to see the Indians treading through the snow, their bare  cal oused  feet  not  seeming  to  worry  them,  while  we  felt  our  toes  freeze  in  the  intense  cold despite our boots and wool y socks. At a weary, steady pace, they trotted along like l amas in single file.  \\n Saved from that rough patch, the truck continued with renewed passion and we soon cleared the highest pass, where there was a strange pyramid made of irregular-sized stones and crowned with  a  cross.  As  the  truck  passed,  almost  everyone  spat  and  one  or  two  crossed  themselves.  \\n Intrigued, we asked what the significance of this strange ritual was but only the most complete of silences met us.  \\n The  sun  was  warming  up  and  the  temperature  became  more  agreeable  as  we  descended, always fol owing the course of a river we had seen begin at the summit of the mountain and grow to a fair size. Snowcapped peaks looked down on us from al  sides and herds of l amas and alpacas looked  on  without  expression  as  the  truck  drove  past,  while  several  uncivilized  vicuñas  fled  the disturbance.  \\n At one of the many stops we made along the road, an Indian timidly approached us with his son who  spoke  good  Spanish,  and  began  to  ask  us  al   about  the  wonderful  “land  of  Perón.”  Our imaginations ignited by the spectacular grandeur we were traveling through, it was easy for us to paint extraordinary events, embel ishing to our hearts’ desire the   capo ’s exploits, fil ing the minds of our listeners with stories of the idyl ic, beautiful life in our country. Through his son, the man asked us for  a  copy  of  the  Argentine  constitution  with  its  declaration  of  the  rights  of  the  elderly,  and  we enthusiastical y  promised  to  send  him  one.  When  we  resumed  the  trip,  the  old  Indian  took  an appetizing  corncob  from  beneath  his  clothes  and  offered  it  to  us.  We  finished  it  off  quickly, democratical y dividing the kernels between us.  \\n In  the  middle  of  the  afternoon,  with  the  heavy,  gray  sky  bearing  down  on  us,  we  passed  an interesting  place  where  erosion  had  worn  the  huge  boulders  on  the  roadside  into  feudal  castles.  \\n They had battlements, gargoyles observing us disconcertingly, and a host of fabulous monsters that \\n seemed  to  be  standing  guard,  protecting  the  tranquil ity  for  the  mythical  characters  who  surely inhabited the place. The slight drizzle which for some time had brushed our faces became stronger and turned into a heavy downpour. The driver cal ed out to the “Argentine doctors,” inviting us into his cabin, the height of comfort in those parts. We immediately made friends with a schoolteacher from  Puno,  whom  the  government  had  sacked  for  being  a  member  of APRA  [American  Popular Revolutionary Al iance].  The  man,  who  clearly  had  indigenous  blood  and  who  moreover  was  an \\n “Aprista” — which meant nothing to us — had many incredible stories of Indian customs and culture, delighting us with a thousand anecdotes and memories of his life as a teacher. Fol owing the cal  of his Indian blood, he had sided with the Aymaras in the never-ending debates among the experts on the region against the Coyas, whom he qualified as cowardly   ladinos .* \\n He also gave us the key to the strange ritual observed by our traveling companions earlier in the  day.  Arriving  at  the  highest  point  of  the  mountain  the  Indian  gifts  al   of  his  sadness  to Pachamama, Mother Earth, in the symbolic form of a stone. These gradual y amass to shape the pyramids we had seen. When the Spaniards arrived to conquer the region they immediately tried to destroy such beliefs and abolish such rituals, but without success. So the Spanish monks decided to  accept  the  inevitable,  placing  a  single  cross  atop  each  pile  of  stones. Al   this  took  place  four centuries ago (as told by Garcilaso de la Vega*) and judging by the number of Indians who made the sign of the cross, the religious didn’t make a lot of progress. The rise of modern transport has meant the faithful now spit out chewed coca leaves instead of placing stones, and this carries their troubles to rest with Pachamama.  \\n The  inspired  voice  of  the  teacher  rose  to  a  resounding  pitch  whenever  he  spoke  about  his Indians,  the  once  rebel ious Aymara  race  who  had  held  the  Inca  armies  in  check,  and  it  fel   to  a vacant depth when he spoke of the Indians’ present condition, brutalized by modern civilization and by their   compañeros , his bitter enemies the mestizos, who revenge themselves on the Aymaras for their own position halfway between two worlds. He spoke of the need to build schools that would orient individuals within their own world, enabling them to play a useful role within it; of the need to change  fundamental y  the  present  system  of  education,  which,  on  the  rare  occasion  it  does  offer Indians  education  (according  only  to  white  man’s  criteria),  simply  fil s  them  with  shame  and resentment, rendering them unable to help their fel ow Indians and at the severe disadvantage of having  to  fight  within  a  hostile  white  society  which  refuses  to  accept  them.  The  destiny  of  those unhappy individuals is to stagnate in some minor bureaucratic position and die hoping that one of their children, thanks to the miraculous powers of a drop of colonizing blood in their veins, might somehow achieve the goal they aspire to until their last days. In the convulsive clenching of his fist one  could  perceive  the  confession  of  a  man  tormented  by  his  own  misfortune,  and  also  the  very desire he attributed to his hypothetical example. Wasn’t he in fact a typical product of an “education”  \\n which  damages  the  person  receiving  its  favor,  a  concession  to  the  magic  power  of  that  single \\n “drop,” even if it came from some poor mestizo woman sold to a local   cacique*  or was the result of an Indian maid’s rape by her drunken Spanish master?  \\n \\n But our journey was almost over and the teacher fel  silent. The road curved and we crossed a bridge over the same river we had first seen early that morning as a tiny stream. Ilave was on the other side.  \\n \\n *Spanish-speaking Latin Americans, often used to refer to Indians who adopt Spanish ways.  \\n *The Inca Garcilaso, son of an Inca princess and a conquistador, was one of the chroniclers of the conquest.  \\n *A local political boss.  \\n EL LAGO DEL SOL \\n lake of the sun \\n \\n The sacred lake revealed only a smal  part of its grandeur. The narrow tongue of land surrounding the bay Puno is built on hid it from view. Reed canoes bobbed here and there in the tranquil water and  a  few  fishing  boats  filed  out  through  the  lake’s  entrance.  The  wind  was  very  cold  and  the smothering, leaden sky seemed to replicate our state of mind. Although we had come directly to Puno without stopping in Ilave, and had secured temporary lodging and a good meal at the local barracks, our luck seemed to have run out. Very politely the commanding officer had shown us the door, explaining that as this was a border checkpoint foreign civilians were strictly forbidden from staying overnight.  \\n We didn’t want to go without exploring the lake, so we went to the pier to see if anyone would take us out in a boat, where we could admire the lake in al  its magnitude. We used an interpreter to advance the operation because none of the fishermen, al  pure Aymara, knew any Spanish at al .  \\n For a modest sum of five   soles , we managed to get them to take both of us and the intrusive guide who was sticking to us. We considered swimming in the lake, but after testing the temperature with the tips of our little fingers we thought better of it (Alberto made a big show of taking off his clothes and boots, only to put them back on again, of course).  \\n Like  tiny  pinpoints  dispersed  across  the  vast,  gray  surface  of  the  lake,  a  group  of  islands emerged in the distance. Our interpreter described the lives of the fishermen there, some of whom have barely ever seen a white man, and who live according to the old ways, eating the same food, fishing with 500-year-old techniques and keeping their costumes, rituals and traditions alive.  \\n \\n When we returned to the port, we walked over to one of the boats running between Puno and a Bolivian port to try and get some   mate , which we were low on. But they drink almost no   mate  in the north of Bolivia, in fact they’d hardly heard of it, and we couldn’t even get a half-kilo. We examined the boat which had been designed in England and built here; its lavishness clashed with the general poverty of the whole region.  \\n Our  problem  of  lodging  found  its  solution  at  the  Civil  Guard  post,  where  a  very  friendly lieutenant let us stay in the infirmary, the two of us in one bed but at least we were cosy and warm.  \\n After a pretty interesting visit to the cathedral the fol owing day, we found a truck heading for Cuzco.  \\n The  doctor  in  Puno  had  given  us  letter  of  introduction  for  Dr.  Hermosa  —  an  ex-leprologist  now living in Cuzco.  \\n \\n Ernesto Guevara and La Poderosa I , 1951.  \\n “And suddenly, slipping in as if part of our fantasy, the question arose: \\n ‘Why don’t we go to North America?’ \\n ‘North America?

That night an assembly of the colony’s patients gave us a farewell serenade, with lots of local songs sung by a blind man. The orchestra was made up of a flute player, a guitarist and an accordion player with almost no fingers, and a ‘healthy’ contingent helping out with a saxophone, a guitar and some percussion.”  \\n \\n Ernesto Guevara and Alberto Granado aboard the   Mambo-Tango , sailing down the Amazon River, June 1952.  \\n “We rowed at full strength and just when it seemed we were definitely on our way, we’d turn a half circle and head back into midstream. We watched with growing desperation as the lights drifted into the distance. Exhausted, we decided that at least we could win the fight against the mosquitoes and sleep peacefully until dawn.”  \\n \\n \\n \\n “After receiving my degree I began to travel through Latin America. Except for Haiti and the Dominican Republic, I have visited \\n — in one way or another — all the countries of Latin America. In the way I traveled, first as a student and afterward as a doctor, I began to come into close contact with poverty, with hunger, with disease, with the inability to cure a child because of a lack of resources… And I began to see there was something that, at that time, seemed to me almost as important as being a famous researcher or making some substantial contribution to medical science, and this was helping those people.”  \\n (from Appendix: “A Child of my Environment,” 1960) \\n HACIA EL OMBLIGO DEL MUNDO \\n toward the navel of the world \\n \\n The first leg of the journey wasn’t too long as the truck driver left us in Juliaca, where we had to find another  truck  to  take  us  further  (ever  northward).  We  went,  of  course,  on  the  recommendation  of \\n Puno’s Civil Guard, to the police station where we found a very drunk sergeant. He took a liking to us  and  invited  us  for  a  drink,  ordering  beers  that  were  downed  in  one,  al   except  for  mine  which remained ful  on the table.  \\n “What’s the matter, my Argentine friend, don’t you drink?”  \\n “No, it’s not that; in my country we don’t normal y drink like this. Don’t feel bad, it’s just that we only drink if we’re eating at the same time.”  \\n “But,   cheee ,”  he  said,  his  nasal  voice  accentuating  our  country’s  onomatopoeic  nickname,  \\n “Why didn’t you say so?” With a clap of his hands he ordered some great cheese sandwiches — \\n and  I  was  fairly  satisfied  with  that.  Then  he  swept  himself  away  into  euphoric  descriptions  of  his various  heroic  deeds,  boasting  about  the  fear  and  respect  the  people  of  the  region  held  him  in because of his fabulous marksmanship. To prove it he pul ed out his gun and said to Alberto: “Look,  cheee , stand 20 meters away with a cigarette in your mouth and if I can’t light it with the first bul et, I’l  give you 50   soles .” Alberto doesn’t like money that much and he wasn’t about to move from his chair, at least not for 50   soles . “Come on,   cheee , I’l  make it 100.” Alberto didn’t move a muscle.  \\n When he got to 200   soles  — laid out on the table — Alberto’s eyes began to flicker, but his instinct for self-preservation was stronger and he stil  didn’t move. So the sergeant took off his cap and, watching through a mirror, tossed it behind him and fired. The cap was stil  in perfect condition, of course, but the wal  wasn’t and the owner of the bar flew into a fury, storming off to the police station to complain.  \\n Within  minutes  an  officer  showed  up  to  find  out  what  the  scandal  was  al   about,  hauling  the sergeant into a corner to give him a talking to. When they rejoined our group the sergeant launched into a tirade against my traveling buddy, also making faces at him so he’d get the point: “Listen up, Argentine, got any more firecrackers like that one you just let off?” Alberto caught on quickly and said, his face the picture of innocence, that he had run out. The officer gave him a warning about letting off fireworks in public places, then told the owner that the incident was over; he could see no sign on the wal  that any gun had been fired. The woman went to ask the sergeant to shift a few centimeters  from  where  he  was  located,  standing  rigidly  against  the  wal ,  but  a  quick  mental calculation of the pros and cons was enough for her to keep her mouth shut on that score and give Alberto  an  extra  tongue  lashing  instead.  “These Argentines  think  they  own  everything,”  she  said, plus a few more insults that were lost in the distance as we fled, one of us thinking wistful y of the beer, the other of the lost sandwiches.  \\n We found another truck to ride in, traveling with a couple of young guys from Lima. The whole time  they  tried  to  show  us  how  much  better  they  were  than  the  silent  Indians,  who  endured  their taunts  and  showed  no  sign  of  being  bothered. At  first  we  looked  the  other  way,  paying  them  no attention,  but  after  some  hours  the  tedious  journey  across  an  interminable  plain  forced  us  to exchange a few words with the only other white people on board, the only ones we could chat with since  the  wary  Indians  barely  dignified  our  questions  with  a  response,  offering  only  monosyl abic \\n \\n replies. In truth these boys from Lima were normal enough, they just needed to make the differences between  themselves  and  the  Indians  clear.  As  we  chewed  vigorously  on  the  coca  leaves  our newfound  friends  had  diligently  obtained  for  us,  a  flood  of  tangos  engulfed  our  unsuspecting companions.  \\n We arrived at last light in a vil age cal ed Ayaviry, where we stayed in a hotel paid for by the head  of  the  Civil  Guard.  “Excuse  me,”  he  responded,  to  our  feeble  protest  against  his  startling gesture. “Two Argentine doctors sleeping rough because they have no money? It can’t be.” But in spite of the warm bed, we could barely keep our eyes closed: throughout the night, the coca we’d ingested revenged our bravado in floods of nausea, colic and severe headache.  \\n We left very early for Sicuani in the same truck the next morning, where we arrived in the middle of the afternoon overwhelmed by too much cold, rain and hunger. As always we spent the night at the  Civil  Guard  post,  and  as  always  they  looked  after  us  wel . A  miserable  little  river  cal ed  the Vilcanota runs through Sicuani, and we would be fol owing the course of its water, an ocean of mud, for a while.  \\n In the Sicuani market we were pondering the whole range of colors overflowing from the stal s, tangling with the vendors’ monotone cries and the monotone buzz of the crowd, when we noticed a gathering of people on a corner and went to investigate.  \\n Surrounded by a dense, silent multitude a procession advanced, at the head of which were a dozen monks wearing colored habits, fol owed by a train of serious-looking notables wearing black dress and carrying a coffin. They marked the end of the formal funeral party and a teeming mass of people  fol owed,  without  order  or  direction.  The  procession  halted  and  one  of  the  black-suited individuals appeared on a balcony — papers in hand: “It is our duty, as we say farewel  to this great and worthy man, somebody or other…” etc. After his interminable babbling, the procession moved a  block  further  and  another  darkly  dressed  character  materialized  on  a  balcony.  “Somebody  or other is dead, but the memory of his good deeds and his unblemished integrity…” etc. And so, poor old somebody or other crossed to his final resting place like this, pursued by the hatred of his fel ow vil agers who on every street corner unburdened themselves of him in flooding words.  \\n Another day’s traveling in much the same manner as previous days, and final y: CUZCO!  \\n EL OMBLIGO \\n the navel \\n   \\n The word that most perfectly describes the city of Cuzco is “evocative.” Intangible dust of another era  settles  on  its  streets,  rising  like  the  disturbed  sediment  of  a  muddy  lake  when  you  touch  its bottom. But there are two or three Cuzcos, or it’s better to say, two or three ways the city can be summoned. When Mama Ocl o dropped her golden wedge into the soil and it sank effortlessly, the first Incas knew this was the place selected by Viracocha to be the permanent home for his chosen ones,  who  had  left  behind  their  nomadic  lives  to  come  as  conquistadors  to  their  promised  land.  \\n With  nostrils  flaring  zealously  for  new  horizons,  they  watched  as  their  formidable  empire  grew, always looking beyond the feeble barrier of the surrounding mountains. The converted nomads set to expanding Tahuantinsuyo, fortifying as they did so the center of their conquered territory — the navel of the world — Cuzco.* And here grew, as a necessary defense for the empire, the imposing Sacsahuamán, dominating the city from its heights and protecting the palaces and temples from the wrath of the enemies of the empire. The vision of this Cuzco emerges mournful y from the fortress destroyed by the stupidity of il iterate Spanish conquistadors, from the violated ruins of the temples, from  the  sacked  palaces,  from  the  faces  of  a  brutalized  race.  This  is  the  Cuzco  inviting  you  to become a warrior and to defend, club in hand, the freedom and the life of the Inca.  \\n High  above  the  city  another  Cuzco  can  be  seen,  displacing  the  destroyed  fortress:  a  Cuzco with colored-tile roofs, its gentle uniformity interrupted by the cuppola of a baroque church; and as the city fal s away it shows us only its narrow streets and its native inhabitants dressed in typical costume,  al   the  local  colors.  This  Cuzco  invites  you  to  be  a  hesitant  tourist,  to  pass  over  things superficial y and relax into the beauty beneath a leaden winter sky.  \\n And there is yet another Cuzco, a vibrant city whose monuments bear witness to the formidable courage of the warriors who conquered the region in the name of Spain, the Cuzco to be found in museums and libraries, in the church facades and in the clear, sharp features of the white chiefs who even today feel pride in the conquest. This is the Cuzco asking you to pul  on your armor and, mounted on the ample back of a powerful horse, cleave a path through the defenseless flesh of a naked  Indian  flock  whose  human  wal   col apses  and  disappears  beneath  the  four  hooves  of  the gal oping beast.  \\n Each one of these Cuzcos can be admired separately, and to each one we dedicated a part of our stay.  \\n \\n *Mama  Ocllo  was  the  sister/wife  of  Manco  Capac,  the  first  Inca  Emperor.  According  to  the  legend,  the  two  were  born simultaneously,  rising  up  from  Lake  Titicaca,  symbolizing  the  unity  and  equality  of  the  masculine  and  feminine  aspects.  \\n Viracocha was the Inca Creator God. Tahuantinsuyo (four quarters) was the Inca world, of which Cuzco was the center.  \\n \\n LA TIERRA DEL INCA \\n the land of the incas \\n \\n Cuzco  is  completely  surrounded  by  mountains  that  signified  less  a  defense  than  a  danger  for  its Inca  inhabitants,  who,  in  order  to  defend  themselves,  built  the  immense  mass  of  a  fortress, Sacsahuamán. This version of the story, at least, satisfies the superficial inquirer, a version which for obvious reasons I cannot discount. It’s possible, however, that the fortress constituted the initial nucleus of the great city. In the period immediately after abandoning nomadic life, when the Incas were  barely  more  than  an  ambitious  tribe  and  defense  against  a  numerical y  superior  adversary was based around closely protecting the settled population, the wal s of Sacsahuamán offered an ideal  site.  This  double  function  of  city  and  fortress  explains  some  of  the  reasoning  behind  its construction, which doesn’t make sense if its purpose was simply to repel an invading enemy, and much less so considering Cuzco lay defenseless on every other periphery. It is worth noting that the fortress is built in such a way that it controls the two steep val eys leading to the city. The serrated wal s  mean  that  when  enemies  attacked  they  could  be  held  hostage  on  three  flanks,  and  if  they penetrated  these  defenses,  they  came  up  against  a  second,  similar  wal   and  then  a  third.  The defenders had room to maneuver, enabling them to concentrate on their counterattack.  \\n Al  this, and the subsequent glory of the city, creates the impression that the Quechua warriors were  undefeated  in  the  defense  of  their  fortress  against  the  pounding  enemies.  Even  though  the fortifications are the expression of a highly inventive people, intuitive in mathematics, they seem to belong  —  in  my  view,  at  least  —  to  the  pre-Inca  stage  of  their  civilization,  a  period  before  they learned  to  appreciate  the  comforts  of  a  material  life;  being  a  sober  race  the  Quechuas  didn’t achieve  a  level  of  cultural  splendor,  but  they  did  make  considerable  advances  in  the  fields  of architecture and the arts. The continued success of the Quechua warriors drove enemy tribes further from Cuzco. Leaving the secure confines of the fortress, that in any case could no longer contain their multiplying race, they spread down the neighboring val ey along the stream whose waters they used.  Highly  conscious  of  their  present  glory,  they  turned  their  eyes  to  the  past  in  search  of  an explanation for their superiority. In honor of the memory of a god whose omnipotence had al owed them to rise to dominance, they created temples and the priest caste. In this way, expressing their greatness in stone, an imposing Cuzco grew into the city eventual y conquered by the Spaniards.  \\n Even today, when the bestial rage of the conquering rabble can be seen in each of the acts \\n designed  to  eternalize  the  conquest,  and  the  Inca  caste  has  long  since  vanished  as  a  dominant power, their stone blocks stand enigmatical y, impervious to the ravages of time. The white troops sacked the already defeated city, attacking the Inca temples with unbridled fury. They unified their greed  for  the  gold  that  covered  the  wal s,  in  perfect  representations  of  Inti  the  Sun  God,  with  the sadistic  pleasure  of  exchanging  the  joyful  and  life-giving  symbol  of  a  grieving  people  for  the bereaved idol of a joyful people. The temples to Inti were razed to their foundations or their wal s were made to serve the ascent of the churches of the new religion: the cathedral was erected over the remains of a grand palace, and above the wal s of the Temple of the Sun rose the Church of Santo Domingo, both lesson and punishment from the proud conqueror. And yet every so often the heart of America, shuddering with indignation, sends a nervous spasm through the gentle back of the Andes, and tumultuous shock waves assault the surface of the land. Three times the cuppola of proud Santo Domingo has col apsed from on high, to the rhythm of broken bones, and its worn wal s have opened and fal en too. But the foundations they rest on are unmoved, the great blocks of the Temple of the Sun indifferently exhibit their gray stone; however colossal the disaster befal ing its oppressor, not one of its huge rocks shifts from its place.  \\n But Kon’s revenge is meager in the face of the magnitude of the insult. The gray stones have grown  tired  of  pleading  with  their  protector  gods  for  the  destruction  of  the  abhorrent  conquering race, and now they simply show an inanimate exhaustion — useful only for provoking the admiring grunts of some tourist or other. What use was the patient labor of the Indians, builders of the Inca Roca Palace, subtle sculptors of angular stone, when faced with the impetuous actions of the white conquistadors and their knowledge of brick work, vaulting and rounded arches?  \\n The anguished Indian, waiting for the terrible vengeance of his gods, saw instead a cloud of churches  rise,  erasing  even  the  possibility  of  a  proud  past.  The  six-meter  wal s  of  the  Inca  Roca Palace,  considered  by  the  conquistadors  to  be  useful  only  as  weight  bearers  for  their  colonial palace, reflect in their perfect stone structures the cry of the defeated warrior.  \\n But the race that created   Ollantay*  left something more than the conglomeration of Cuzco as a monument to its grand past. Along the Vilcanota or Urubamba Rivers, over more than a hundred kilometers, the signs of the Inca past are scattered. The most important of them are always in the heights of the mountains, where their fortresses were impenetrable and secure from surprise attack.  \\n After trekking for two long hours along a rough path we reached the peak of Pisac; also arriving there,  though  long  before  us,  were  the  swords  of  the  Spanish  soldiers,  destroying  Pisac’s defenders, defenses and even its temple. Among the dispersed mass of disorganized stone you can perceive that it was once a defensive construction, the dwel ings of the priests; the place where Intiwatana stayed and where he caught and tied up the midday sun. So little is left!  \\n Tracing  the  course  of  the  Vilcanota  and  passing  by  some  relatively  unimportant  sites,  we reached  Ol antaytambo,  a  vast  fortress  where  Manco  I *  rose  up  in  arms  against  the  Spaniards, resisting Hernando Pizarro’s troops and founding the minor dynasty of the Four Incas. This dynasty \\n coexisted  with  the  Spanish  Empire  until  its  last  effeminate  representative  was  assassinated  in Cuzco’s main square, on the orders of Viceroy Toledo.  \\n A rocky hil  no less than 100 meters high plunges suddenly to the Vilcanota River. The fortress rests on top and its single vulnerable side, connected to its mountain neighbors by narrow paths, is guarded by stone defenses that easily impede the access of any attacking force similar in strength to the defenders. The lower part of the construction has a purely defensive purpose, its less steep areas split into some 20 easily defendable levels, making an attacker vulnerable to counterattack on each side. The upper part of the fortress contained the soldiers’ quarters, and is crowned by a temple which probably housed their loot in the form of precious metal objects. But of al  that not even a  memory  remains,  and  even  the  massive  stone  blocks  that  made  up  the  temple  have  been removed from their resting place.  \\n Near  Sacsahuamán,  on  the  road  returning  to  Cuzco,  there’s  an  example  of  typical  Inca construction which, in our guide’s opinion, was a bathing place for the Incas. This seemed a little strange to me, given the distance between the site and Cuzco, unless it was a ritual bathing place for  the  monarch  only.  The  ancient  Inca  emperors  (if  this  version  is  correct)  must  have  had  even tougher  skins  than  their  descendants  because  the  water,  though  wonderful  to  drink,  is  extremely cold.  The  site,  crowned  with  three  deep  trapezoidal  recesses  (whose  form  and  purpose  are unclear), is cal ed Tambomachay and is at the entrance of the Val ey of the Incas.  \\n But  the  site  whose  archaeological  and  “touristic”  significance  overwhelms  al   others  in  the region  is  Machu  Picchu,  which  in  the  indigenous  language  means  Old  Mountain.  The  name  is completely divorced from the settlement which sheltered within its hold the last members of a free people. For Bingham, the [U.S.] archaeologist who discovered the ruins, the place was more than a refuge  against  invaders,  but  was  the  original  settlement  of  the  dominant  Quechua  race  and  a sacred site for them. Later, in the period of the Spanish conquest, it also became a hideout for the defeated army. At first glance there are several indications that the above-mentioned archaeologist was  right.  In  Ol antaytambo,  for  example,  the  most  important  defensive  constructions  face  away from Machu Picchu, even though the slope behind is not steep enough to ensure effective defense against  attack  from  there,  possibly  suggesting  that  their  backs  were  covered  in  that  direction. A further indication is their preoccupation with keeping the area hidden from outsiders, even after al resistance  had  been  crushed.  The  last  Inca  himself  was  captured  far  from  Machu  Picchu,  where Bingham found skeletons that were almost al  female. He identified them as being those of virgins of the Temple of the Sun, a religious order whose members the Spaniards never managed to flush out. As  is  customary  in  constructions  like  this,  the  Temple  of  the  Sun  with  its  famous  Intiwatana crowns the city. It is carved from the rock which also serves as its pedestal, and close by a series of careful y polished stones suggest that this is a very important place. Looking out across the river are three  trapezoidal  windows  typical  of  Quechua  architecture,  which  Bingham  identified  as  the windows through which the Ayl us brothers in Inca mythology came to the outside world to show the chosen  people  the  path  to  their  promised  land.  To  my  understanding  the  argument  is  a  little \\n strained.  The  interpretation  has,  of  course,  been  contested  by  a  great  many  prestigious researchers. There is also voluminous debate about the function of the Temple of the Sun whose discoverer, Bingham, maintained it was a circular enclosure, similar to the temple dedicated to the same  sun  god  in  Cuzco.  Whatever  the  case,  the  form  and  cut  of  the  stones  suggest  it  was  of principal importance, and it is thought that beneath the huge stones that form the temple’s base lies the tomb of the Incas.  \\n Here you can easily appreciate the difference between the various social classes of the vil age, each of them occupying a distinct place according to their grouping, and remaining more or less independent from the rest of the community. It’s a pity they knew no other roofing matter besides straw; now there are no examples of roofing left, even on the most luxurious sites. But for architects who had no knowledge of vaulting or arch supports, it must have been very difficult to resolve this problem. In the buildings reserved for the warriors, we were shown cavities in the stone wal s, like smal  chambers; on either side of them holes just big enough for a man’s arm to pass through had been hol owed out. This was apparently a place of physical punishment; the victim was forced to place  both  arms  through  the  respective  holes  and  was  then  pushed  backwards  until  his  bones broke. I was unconvinced about the effectiveness of the procedure and introduced my limbs in the manner indicated. Alberto pushed me slowly: the slight pressure provoked excruciating pain and the sensation that I would be torn apart completely if he continued to press my chest.  \\n But  you  can  real y  appreciate  the  imposing  magnitude  of  the  city-fortress  from  the  view  at Huayna Picchu (Young Mountain), rising some 200 meters higher. The place must have been used as a kind of lookout point rather than as housing or as fortifications because the ruins are only of minor  importance.  Machu  Picchu  is  impregnable  on  two  of  its  sides,  defended  by  an  abyss dropping a sheer 300 meters to the river and a narrow gorge linking up with the “young mountain”; its most vulnerable side is defensible from a succession of terraces, making any attack against it extremely difficult, while toward Machu Picchu’s face, looking approximately south, vast fortifications and  the  natural  narrowing  of  the  hil top  make  a  difficult  pass  through  which  to  attack.  If  you remember also that the torrential Vilcanota rushes around the base of the mountain, you can see that the first inhabitants of Machu Picchu were wise in their choice.  \\n In reality it hardly matters what the primitive origins of the city are. It’s best, in any case, to leave discussion of the subject to archaeologists. The most important and irrefutable thing, however, is that here we found the pure expression of the most powerful indigenous race in the Americas — \\n untouched by a conquering civilization and ful  of immensely evocative treasures between its wal s.  \\n The wal s themselves have died from the tedium of having no life between them. The spectacular landscape  circling  the  fortress  supplies  an  essential  backdrop,  inspiring  dreamers  to  wander  its ruins for the sake of it; North American tourists, constrained by their practical world view, are able to place those members of the disintegrating tribes they may have seen in their travels among these once-living wal s, unaware of the moral distance separating them, since only the semi-indigenous spirit of the South American can grasp the subtle differences.  \\n \\n \\n *An epic drama of the Inca General Ollanta, put to death for falling in love with an Inca princess.  \\n *Put on the Inca throne by Hernando Pizarro after helping to unseat Atahualpa, Manco II in turn fought the Spaniards. His first rebellion was crushed at Ollantaytambo in 1536.  \\n EL SEÑOR DE LOS TEMBLORES \\n our lord of the earthquakes \\n \\n From the cathedral, the peals of the María Angola rung out for the first time since the earthquake.  \\n Legend has it that this famous bel , among the largest in the world, contains 27 kilograms of gold. It was supposedly donated by a lady cal ed María Angulo, but the name of the bel  itself was changed due to a slight problem with rhyming slang.* \\n The cost of restoring the cathedral bel  towers, destroyed by the earthquake of 1950, had been met by General Franco’s government,** and as a gesture of gratitude the band was ordered to play the Spanish national anthem. As the first chords sounded, the bishop’s red headdress locked itself into position as he moved his arms about like a puppet. “Stop, stop, there’s been a mistake,” he whispered, while the indignant voice of a Spaniard could be heard, “Two years’ work, and they play this!” I couldn’t say whether with good intentions or otherwise, the band had struck up the Spanish Republican anthem.  \\n In the afternoon he leaves his stately home in the cathedral, Our Lord of the Earthquakes, who is no more than a dark brown image of Christ. He is paraded throughout the city and his pilgrimage stops at al  the main churches. As he passes, a crowd of layabouts competes with each other to throw  handfuls  of  the  little  flowers  that  grow  abundantly  on  the  slopes  of  the  nearby  mountains, named by the natives   nucchu . The violent red of the flowers, the intense bronze of the Lord of the Earthquakes  and  the  silver  altar  they  carry  him  on  lend  the  procession  the  impression  that  it’s  a pagan festival. This feeling is intensified by the many-colored clothes of the Indians, who wear for the occasion their best traditional costumes in expression of a culture or way of life which stil  holds on  to  living  values.  In  contrast,  a  cluster  of  Indians  in  European  clothes  march  at  the  head  of  the procession,  carrying  banners.  Their  tired,  affected  faces  resemble  an  image  of  those  Quechuas who refused to heed Manco I ’s cal , pledging themselves to Pizarro and in the degradation of their \\n \\n defeat smothering the pride of an independent race.  \\n Standing over the smal  frames of the Indians gathered to see the procession pass, the blond head  of  a  North American  can  occasional y  be  glimpsed.  With  his  camera  and  sports  shirt,  he seems to be (and, in fact, actual y is) a correspondent from another world lost amid the isolation of the Inca Empire.  \\n \\n *Because it rhymed with   culo  (ass in Spanish).  \\n **General Franco was military dictator in Spain from 1936 until his death in 1975.  \\n EL SOLAR DEL VENCEDOR \\n homeland for the victor \\n \\n What was once the lavish capital of the Inca Empire conserved much of its bril iance for many years out of simple inertia. There were new men flaunting its riches, but they were the same riches. For a time they were not merely maintained but augmented, with the products of the gold and silver mines that converged on the region; the sole difference being that Cuzco no longer bore the title “navel of the world” but was just another point on its periphery. Its treasures emigrated to the new metropolis across the sea to feed the opulence of another imperial court. The Indians no longer worked with determination at the barren soil; yet the conquistadors had not come to fight daily with the land for their  sustenance,  but  to  gain  easy  fortunes  through  heroic  deeds  or  simple  greed.  Slowly  Cuzco languished, pushed to the margins, lost in the cordil era. On the Pacific coast a new rival emerged, Lima, growing with the fruits of the taxes levied by clever intermediaries on the wealth flowing out of Peru. Although  there  was  no  cataclysm  by  which  to  mark  the  transition,  the  bril iant  Inca  capital passed  into  its  current  state,  a  relic  of  times  gone  by.  Only  recently  has  one  or  other  modern building  arisen  to  clash  with  the  existing  col ection,  but  otherwise  al   the  monuments  of  colonial splendor stil  remain.  \\n The cathedral is grounded firmly in the center of the city. Its solidity, typical to its era, makes it look more like a fortress than a church. The glitz of its bril iant interior reflects a glorious past; the giant  paintings  reposing  on  the  lateral  wal s  do  not  measure  up  to  riches  scattered  through  the sanctuary but somehow they do not seem out of place, and a St. Christopher emerging from the water  seemed,  at  least  to  me,  a  fine  piece.  The  earthquake  wreaked  havoc  there  as  wel :  the \\n \\n frames of the paintings are broken and the paintings themselves scratched and creased. The effect created by the golden frames and the golden doors to the side altars al  fal ing off their hinges is very strange, as if they’re revealing the lesions of age. Gold doesn’t have the gentle dignity of silver which becomes more charming as it ages, and so the cathedral seems to be decorated like an old woman with too much makeup. There is real artistry in the choir stal s, made from wood by Indian or mestizo craftsmen. In their carved scenes of the lives of the saints, they have infused the cedar with the spirit of the Catholic Church and the enigmatic soul of the true Andean peoples.  \\n One of Cuzco’s jewels, worthy of the visits by each and every tourist, is the pulpit of the Basilica of San Blas. It has nothing more to show for itself except the fine carving, before which you pause, enraptured,  and  like  the  choir  stal s  of  the  cathedral  it  expresses  the  fusion  of  two  hostile  but somehow  almost  complementary  races.  The  whole  city  is  an  immense  gal ery:  the  churches,  of course,  but  even  every  house,  every  balcony  looking  out  over  every  street,  is  like  a  medium  with which to evoke times past. Each of those does not have the same merit, of course. But as I write in this moment, so far from there, when my notes before me seem faded and artificial, I’m unable to say which impressed me the most. Amid the magma of churches we visited I remember the pitiful image of the bel  towers of the Church of Belén, toppled by the earthquake, lying like dismembered animals on the hil side.  \\n After  careful  analysis,  there  are  very  few  works  of  art  capable  of  standing  up  under  close inspection;  Cuzco  is  not  a  city  to  visit  for  this  or  that  painting.  Rather,  it’s  the  whole  of  the  city together  which  creates  the  impression  of  the  peaceful,  if  sometimes  disquieting,  center  of  a civilization that has long since passed.  \\n CUZCO A SECAS \\n cuzco straight \\n \\n If everything that goes to make up Cuzco were erased from the face of the earth and in its place a little, history-less vil age appeared, there would stil  always be something to say about it. As if mixing cocktails,  we  threw  al   our  impressions  together.  Our  life  in  those  two  weeks  never  lost  the  hobo character which marked our whole journey. The letter of introduction we had for Dr. Hermosa turned out to be fairly useful, although in actual fact he was not the type of man who needed such a formal presentation to lend a hand. It was enough for him to know Alberto had worked with Dr. Fernández, one  of  the  most  eminent  leprologists  in  the Americas,  and Alberto  brandished  the  card  with  his \\n customary skil . Extensive discussion with Dr. Hermosa gave us an approximate picture of Peruvian life and the opportunity to make a trip around the entire Val ey of the Incas in his car. He was very kind to us and he was also the one who found us train tickets to Machu Picchu.  \\n The  average  speed  of  the  regional  trains  is  about  10  to  20  kilometers  an  hour  —  such consumptive  conditions  achieved  by  being  constantly  affronted  with  considerable  climbs  and descents. In order that trains might win against the difficult ascent as they leave the city, the tracks had to be constructed in such a way that the train moves forward for a while, then slips backwards to another track from where it begins a new climb, and this back and forth is repeated several times until it reaches to the top and begins its descent along the course of a river which eventual y flows into  the  Vilcanota.  On  the  train  trip  we  met  a  pair  of  Chilean  swindlers,  sel ing  herbs  and  tel ing fortunes. They were very friendly toward us, sharing their food after we had invited them to drink our  mate . On reaching the ruins, we stumbled across a group of footbal ers and were invited to play. I had  the  opportunity  to  show  off  a  few  impressive  saves,  before  humbly  admitting  that  I’d  played premier league footbal  in Buenos Aires with Alberto, who demonstrated his skil  in midfield on a pitch the locals cal  a   pampa . Our relatively spectacular flair gained us the attention of the owner of the bal  who was also the manager of the hotel. He invited us to stay a couple of days there, until the next gang of North Americans were shipped in on their special rail coaches. Señor Soto, as wel  as being a wonderful individual, was also a very learned person, and after exhausting his favorite topic of sport we were able to speak at length about Inca culture, about which he knew a great deal.  \\n We felt pretty sad when the time came to leave. We drank the last exquisite coffee prepared by Señora Soto and boarded the little train for its 12-hour trip back to Cuzco. In these types of trains there are third-class carriages “reserved” for the local Indians: they’re like the cattle transportation wagons  they  use  in Argentina,  except  that  the  smel   of  cow  shit  is  ever  more  pleasant  than  the human  version.  The  somewhat  animal-like  concept  the  indigenous  people  have  of  modesty  and hygiene  means  that  irrespective  of  gender  or  age  they  do  their  business  by  the  roadside,  the women  cleaning  themselves  with  their  skirts,  the  men  not  bothering  at  al ,  and  then  carry  on  as before.  The  underskirts  of  Indian  women  who  have  kids  are  literal y  warehouses  of  excrement,  a consequence of the way they wipe the rascals every time one of them passes wind. Of course, the tourists  traveling  in  their  comfortable  rail  coaches  could  only  glean  the  vaguest  idea  of  the conditions in which the Indians live, from the fast glimpses they catch as they speed past our train, which  has  stopped  to  let  them  pass.  The  fact  that  it  was  the  U.S.  archaeologist  Bingham  who discovered the ruins, and expounded his findings in easily accessible articles for the general public, means that Machu Picchu is by now very famous in that country to the north and the majority of North Americans visiting Peru come here. (In general they fly direct to Lima, tour Cuzco, visit the ruins and return straight home, not believing that anything else is worth seeing.) The archaeological museum in Cuzco is pretty poor. When the authorities opened their eyes to the mountain of treasure being smuggled out of the various sites, it was already too late. Treasure hunters,  tourists,  foreign  archaeologists,  anyone  at  al   with  any  interest  in  the  subject,  had \\n \\n systematical y looted the region and they were able to col ect for the museum only what remained: virtual y the scraps. Even so, for people like us, without much archaeological education and with only muddled and recently acquired knowledge of Inca civilization, there was enough to see, and we saw it over several days. The mestizo curator was very knowledgeable, with a breathtaking enthusiasm for the race whose blood flowed in his veins. He spoke to us of the splendid past and the present misery,  of  the  urgent  need  to  educate  the  Indians,  as  a  first  step  toward  total  rehabilitation.  He insisted that immediately raising the economic level of Indian families was the only way to mitigate the soporific effects of coca and drink. He talked of fostering a ful er and more exact understanding of the Quechua people so that individuals of that race could look at their past and feel pride, rather than, looking at their present, feel only shame at belonging to the Indian or mestizo class. At that time  the  coca  problem  was  being  debated  in  the  United  Nations  and  we  told  him  about  our experience  with  the  drug  and  its  effects.  He  replied  that  the  same  had  happened  to  him,  and exploded with a string of abuse against those who make profits from poisoning large numbers of people. The Col a and Quechua races are the majority in Peru and are the only ones who consume coca. The semi-indigenous features of the curator, his eyes shining with enthusiasm and his faith in the future, constituted one more treasure of the museum, but a living museum, proof of a race stil fighting for its identity.  \\n HUAMBO \\n huambo \\n \\n Our  source  of  doorbel s  dried  up  and  fol owing  Gardel’s  advice  we  turned  to  face  the  north.* \\n Abancay was a forced stop because from there the trucks left for Huancarama, the last town before the leper colony at Huambo. Our preferred method of soliciting bed and board didn’t change at al from before (Civil Guard and hospital), neither did that of transportation — hitching a lift — except that for the latter we had to wait two days because no trucks departed during Easter. We wandered aimlessly  around  the  little  vil age,  finding  nothing  particularly  interesting,  not  enough  to  forget  our hunger, with the hospital food being so scarce. Lying in a field next to a stream, we looked at the sky as it changed with evening, dreaming up memories of past loves, or picturing in every cloud the tempting image of ordinary food.  \\n Returning to the police station for some sleep, we took a short cut and lost our way completely.  \\n We made our way through fields and over fences, eventual y coming to rest on the porch of a house.  \\n We  had  already  climbed  a  stone  wal   when  we  saw  a  dog  and  his  owner,  il uminated  by  the  ful moon, looking like ghosts! But we didn’t realize that our figures, outlined against the night, would have been much more terrifying. In response to my polite “good evening” we heard only unintel igible noise  —  I  think  I  caught  the  word  “Viracocha!”*  —  and  then  man  and  dog  fled  into  the  house ignoring our apologies and friendly cal s. We left, calmly, by the front gate leading on to a path which seemed more like the right way.  \\n In  one  of  those  moments  of  boredom  we  went  to  the  church  to  watch  up  close  a  little  local ceremony. The poor priest was attempting a three-hour sermon but by then — an hour and a half into  it  —  he  had  exhausted  his  stock  of  maxims.  He  looked  over  the  congregation,  his  eyes pleading, while with his hands he pointed desperately to different parts of the church. “Look, look, the Lord has come to us, the Lord is among us and His spirit guides us.” After a moment’s truce, the priest set off on another tangent and just when it seemed he would hold his silence — a moment of high drama — he sent himself off again into similar nonsense. The fifth or sixth time that a patient Christ was introduced, we got an attack of hysterics and left hurriedly.  \\n What  exactly  brought  on  an  asthma  attack  I  can’t  say  (though  I  can  guess  one  of  the  faithful does), but by the time we arrived in Huancarama I could hardly stand on my feet. I had no adrenalin and my asthma worsened. Wrapped in a police blanket, I watched the rain and smoked one black cigarette  after  another,  which  helped  to  relieve  the  fatigue  somewhat.  Sometime  near  dawn  I managed to fal  asleep, leaning against a pil ar in the hal way. By the morning I felt a little better and Alberto found some adrenalin, which along with some aspirin left me feeling as good as new.  \\n We notified the lieutenant governor, a sort of vil age mayor, of our presence and asked him for a  couple  of  horses  to  take  us  to  the  leper  colony.  The  very  friendly  man  attended  to  us  happily, promising that in five minutes we’d have horses waiting for us at the police station. As we waited for the animals, we stopped to watch a motley group of guys exercising to the domineering commands of the soldier who’d been so kind to us just the day before. On seeing us arrive, he saluted us with great  deference,  then  continued  delivering  his  orders  for  every  type  of  dril   to  the  clowns  in  his charge. Only one out of every five young men of eligible age completes military service in Peru, but the  rest  are  submitted  to  dril s  each  Sunday  and  these  were  the  soldier’s  victims  we  were witnessing. In fact, they were al  victims: the conscripts suffered the wrath of their instructor, and he his  pupils’  sluggishness.  Not  understanding  most  of  his  Spanish;  not  grasping  the  fundamental importance of turning this way, then that; nor of marching then stopping at the whim of their boss, they did everything halfheartedly and were enough to make anyone get angry.  \\n The horses arrived and the soldier al otted us a guide who spoke nothing but Quechua. The route  began  with  a  mountainous  track  which  no  other  horses  would  have  been  able  to  cross, preceded by the guide on foot who took the horses’ bridles in difficult sections. We’d covered about two-thirds of the distance when an old woman and a boy appeared. They grabbed our reins and launched into a lengthy tirade of which we recognized a word sounding like “horse.” We thought at \\n first  they  were  sel ing  cane  baskets  because  the  old  woman  was  carrying  a  good  many.  “Me  no want buy, me no want,” I kept saying to her, and would have continued in that vein if Alberto hadn’t reminded me that our interlocutors were Quechua, not relatives of Tarzan and the apes. We final y found a person coming from the opposite direction who spoke Spanish, who explained to us that these Indians were the owners of the horses; that they were riding past the front of the lieutenant governor’s house when he had taken their horses and presented them to us. One of the conscripts, the  owner  of  my  horse,  had  come  seven  leagues  to  comply  with  his  military  duty,  and  the  poor, elderly woman lived in the opposite direction to where we were heading. We did what any decent person  would  do  —  dismounted,  and  continued  along  the  road  on  foot,  the  guide  ahead  of  us hauling al  our things on his back. We completed the last stretch to the leper colony like this, where we  gave  our  guide  one   sol   in  recompense.  He  thanked  us  profusely,  despite  it  being  such  a pathetic amount.  \\n The head of the clinic, Señor Montejo, received us, and though he couldn’t put us up he said he’d  send  us  to  the  home  of  one  of  the  region’s  landowners,  which  is  exactly  what  he  did.  The rancher gave us a room with beds and food, al  that we needed. The fol owing morning we went to pay a visit to the patients in the little hospital. The people who are in charge do a great job, even if it goes unnoticed. The general state of the place is disastrous; two-thirds of a smal  area — the size of  less  than  half  a  block  —  is  designated  as  a  “sick  zone,”  and  in  it  the  entire  lives  of  the  31 \\n condemned take place. They pass the time watching indifferently for death to arrive (at least that’s what I think). Sanitary conditions are appal ing, and though this might cause no adverse effects on the Indians from the mountains, people coming from other parts, even if only slightly more educated, find it enormously distressing. The thought of having to spend their whole lives between four adobe wal s,  surrounded  by  people  speaking  another  language,  with  only  four  orderlies  who  make  just short visits each day, causes nervous breakdowns.  \\n We went into a room with a straw roof, its ceiling slatted with cane and an earth floor where a white  girl  was  reading   Cousin Basilio  by Queirós. No sooner had we begun to talk when the girl broke down, crying inconsolably, describing her life as a “calvary,” a living hel . The poor girl, from the Amazonian regions, had gone to Cuzco where they gave her the bad news, and said they would send her to a much better place to be cured. The hospital in Cuzco, by no means perfect, did have a certain level of comfort. I believe her expression, the word calvary, was the only just expression for the girl’s situation. The only acceptable thing in this hospital was the drug treatment, the rest could have been borne only by the suffering, fatalistic spirit of the Peruvian mountain Indians.  \\n The  imbecility  of  the  neighboring  locals  only  heightened  the  isolation  of  both  patients  and medical staff. One of them told us that the head surgeon at the clinic needed to perform a more or less  serious  operation,  impossible  at  any  rate  to  execute  on  a  kitchen  table  and  lacking  the appropriate surgical equipment. So he asked for a place, even if it was the morgue, in a nearby hospital at Andahuaylas. The answer was negative, and the patient died without treatment. Señor Montejo  told  us  that  when  this  leprosy  treatment  center  was  founded,  on  the  initiative  of  the \\n \\n renowned leprologist Dr. Pesce, he himself had been responsible, from the center’s inception, for organizing new services. When he arrived in the town Huancarama, not one of the hostels or hotels would let him a room for the night; the one or two friends he had in town refused to give him shelter and in light of the fact that rain was looming, he had been forced to seek refuge in a pigsty, where he passed the night. The patient I spoke of earlier had to walk to the leper colony because there was no one who would lend her and her companion horses — this was years after the colony had been founded.  \\n After welcoming us in great style, they took us to see a new hospital going up a few kilometers from the old one. As they asked for our opinions, the orderlies’ eyes shone proudly, as if the building was their own creation, built adobe brick by adobe brick through their own sweat. It seemed a little heartless to emphasize our criticisms. But the new leper colony has the same disadvantages as the old:  it  lacks  a  laboratory,  it  lacks  surgical  facilities  and,  to  exacerbate  matters,  it’s  situated  in  an area infested by mosquitoes, representing pure torture for anyone who has to spend a whole day there. Yes, it’s capable of housing 250 patients, a resident doctor and it has made some advances in hygiene, but there is stil  a lot to do.  \\n After two days’ stay in the region, during which my asthma worsened, we decided to leave and try to get some proper treatment further on.  \\n With horses provided by the rancher who had given us lodging, we set off on the return journey, accompanied  by  the  same  laconic  Quechua-speaking  guide  who  carried  our  bags  at  the landowner’s  insistence.  In  the  mentality  of  the  district’s  rich  people  it’s  perfectly  natural  that  the servant, although traveling on foot, should carry al  the weight and discomfort. We waited until the first bend erased us from sight and took our bags from our guide, whose enigmatic face revealed nothing of whether or not he appreciated the gesture.  \\n We  again  stayed  with  the  Civil  Guard  back  in  Huancarama,  until  finding  a  truck  to  take  us further in our determined northward direction, which we secured the next day. After an exhausting day  of  travel,  we  final y  arrived  in  the  town  of Andahuaylas,  and  I  went  straight  to  the  hospital  to recover.  \\n \\n *Carlos Gardel was a famous Argentine actor and singer/composer of tangos.  \\n *Inca Creator God. The term is sometimes also used by Indians for white people.  \\n SIEMPRE AL NORTE \\n ever northward \\n \\n After resting for two days in the hospital, and partly recovered, we abandoned that refuge to once again accept the charity of our great friends the Civil Guard, who received us with good humor as usual.  We  were  so  short  on  money  we  were  almost  scared  to  eat;  we  didn’t  want  to  work  until reaching Lima where there was the reasonable hope we’d find better paid work and save enough to continue on the road, since there was stil  no talk of turning back.  \\n The  first  night’s  wait  passed  wel   enough  because  the  lieutenant  in  charge  of  the  post,  an accommodating type, invited us to eat, and we ate enough to store up for whatever lay ahead. Only hunger, however, by now a daily companion, marked the fol owing two days, and boredom; it was impossible to go very far from the checkpoint since the truck drivers inevitably had to go there to get their papers checked, before beginning or continuing their journeys.  \\n At the end of the third day, our fifth in Andahuaylas, we found what we’d been waiting for in the form  of  a  truck  heading  to  Ayacucho.  Just  in  time,  it  turned  out,  because  Alberto  had  reacted violently on seeing Civil Guard soldiers insulting an Indian woman who had come to bring food to her  imprisoned  husband.  His  reaction  must  have  seemed  completely  alien  to  people  who considered the Indians were no more than objects, who deserve to live but only just. After that, we fel  out of favor.  \\n With  night  fal ing,  we  left  the  vil age  in  whose  obligatory  hiatus  we  had  been  prisoners  for several days. The truck now had to climb to the peak of the mountains guarding the northerly exit from Andahuaylas, and it got colder by the minute. To top it off, we were completely drenched by one of the violent regional rainstorms and this time we had no defense against it, instal ed as we were in the tray of a truck taking 10 young bul s to Lima and charged with their care, together with an Indian boy who was also the driver’s helper. We al  spent the night in a town named Chincheros. As for ourselves, so cold we had forgotten we were also pariahs, without money, we ate a very modest meal  and  asked  for  one  bed  for  both  of  us.  Our  request  was  accompanied,  needless  to  say,  by many tears and lamentations that must have moved the owner somewhat: five   soles  for everything.  \\n We spent the whole next day passing from deep ravines to the   pampas , as they cal  the tablelands on top of the mountain chains throughout Peru. The country’s irregular topography knows almost no plains  at  al ,  save  for  the  forested  regions  of  the Amazon.  Our  job  increased  in  difficulty  with  the passing of the hours, since the animals, having lost the layer of sawdust they had been standing on, and grown tired of waiting in the same position absorbing the jolts of the truck, started fal ing over.  \\n We had to get them back on their feet, because of the danger that an animal trampled by the others might die.  \\n At one particular moment Alberto thought that the horn of one animal was scraping the eye of another and told the young Indian who was close to the action. With a shrug of his shoulders, into \\n \\n which he poured the whole spirit of his race, he said, “Why, when al  it’l  ever see is shit,” and quietly continued tying a knot, the task he’d been dedicated to before being interrupted.  \\n We final y arrived in Ayacucho, famous in Latin American history for the decisive battle Bolívar won  on  the  plains  circumscribing  the  town.  The  terrible  street  lighting  plaguing  the  whole  of  the Peruvian sierra reached its worst there; the electric lights emit only the slightest orange glow which shines throughout the night. A gentleman, whose hobby it was to col ect foreign friends, invited us to sleep at his house and the next day found a truck heading north for us, so we could only visit one or two of the 33 churches the little town holds within its urban boundaries. We said farewel  to our good friend and set off again for Lima.  \\n POR EL CENTRO PERUANO \\n through the center of peru \\n \\n Our journey continued in much the same way, eating now and then whenever some generous soul took pity on our indigence. Stil , we never ate very much and the deficit became even graver when we were told that evening there had been a landslide further ahead and we couldn’t pass; we would have to spend the night in a little vil age cal ed Anco. Early the next day we set off again, mounted on our truck, but only a little way up the road we reached the landslide and had to spend the day there, starving and curious, observing the workers set explosives to the huge boulders that had fal en on the  road.  For  every  laborer,  there  were  no  less  than  five  bossy  supervisors,  shouting  out  their opinions and hindering the work of the dynamiters, who were not exactly model workers themselves.  \\n We tried to fool our hunger by going down to swim in the torrential river running through the gul y below, but the water was too icy to stay in for long and neither of us is particularly resistant to the cold, as I’ve said before. In the end, after one of our stock stories of woe, one of the men gave us some corn cobs and another a cow’s heart and some offal.  \\n A woman loaned us her pot and we began to organize our meal, but halfway through the task the dynamiters freed the road and the troupe of trucks began to move. The woman took back her pot and we had to eat the corn uncooked and put away the raw meat. To cap off our misery, night was closing in and a terrible rainstorm transformed the road into a dangerous river of mud. There was only room for one truck at a time, so those on the far side of the landslide came through first, fol owed by those on our side. We were among the first in a long line, but the differential on the very first  truck  broke  when  pushed  too  violently  by  the  tractor  assisting  in  the  hard  crossings,  and  we \\n were al  blocked again. Final y, a jeep with a pul ey on the front came down from the other side of the hil , hauling the truck to the side of the road, al owing the rest of us to continue on our way. The vehicle drove through the night and as usual we went from more or less sheltered val eys on to those frigid  Peruvian   pampas  where we were stabbed by the ice and driving rain. Our teeth chattered, Alberto’s and mine, from the chil  caused by sitting in the same position, and we took turns to stretch our  legs  to  stop  them  cramping.  Our  hunger  was  a  like  a  strange  animal,  living  not  just  in  one particular part but al  over our bodies, making us nervous and bad tempered.  \\n We arrived in Huancal o with first light breaking and walked the 15 blocks from where the truck dropped us to the Civil Guard post, our regular stopover. We bought some bread, made   mate  and were beginning to take out our famous raw heart and offal but had not even stoked up the embers of a recently made fire when a truck heading to Oxapampa offered us a ride. Our interest in going to the place stemmed from the fact that the mother of one of our Argentine   compañeros  lived there, at least we thought she did. We were holding on to the hope that she might help kil  our hunger for a few days and perhaps even adorn us with a   sol  or two. So we left Huancal o almost without seeing it, motivated by the eager cries of our exhausted stomachs.  \\n The first part of the road was wonderful, passing through a little group of towns, but by six in the evening we had begun a perilous descent down an extremely narrow road, wide enough for only one  vehicle  at  a  time.  It  was  general y  the  case  that  only  traffic  coming  from  one  direction  was permitted  to  pass  on  any  given  day,  but  for  some  unknown  reason  they  had  made  this  day  an exception,  and  the  trucks  negotiated  their  crossings,  shouting  profusely  and  tightly  maneuvering; their rear wheels inching out over the precipitous edges — not exactly a calming spectacle.  \\n Alberto and I crouched in each corner of the truck, ready to jump for solid ground at the first sign  of  any  accident,  but  our  Indian  traveling  companions  didn’t  move  a  muscle.  Our  fears  were based in fact, however, since a good many crosses punctuating this part of the mountainous coast mark the mishaps of less fortunate col eagues among the drivers using the route. And every truck that  ran  off  the  road  took  its  tremendous  human  cargo  with  it,  down  the  200-meter  abyss  to  the seething  river  below  —  laying  waste  to  any  hope  of  survival.  Every  single  accident,  according  to regional accounts, had left every single person dead — not a sole injured survivor.  \\n This time, luckily, nothing unpleasant happened and at about 10 at night we reached a vil age by  the  name  of  La  Merced.  It  rested  in  a  low-lying,  tropical  area  and  had  the  typical  look  of  any jungle  vil age. Another  charitable  soul  ceded  us  a  bed  for  the  night  and  a  huge  meal.  The  meals were included at the last moment when the man came to see if we were okay and we had no time to hide the peel of some oranges we had picked from some tree to try and calm our hunger.  \\n In the town’s Civil Guard post we learned unhappily that trucks didn’t have to stop to register, making it very hard to hitch any rides. While there, we witnessed the reporting of a murder, by the victim’s son and an ostentatious mulatto who said he was an intimate friend of the dead man. The act  had  mysteriously  occurred  some  days  earlier,  and  the  prime  suspect  was  an  Indian  whose \\n \\n photo the two men had brought with them. The sergeant showed it to us, saying, “Look, doctors, the classic  image  of  a  murderer.”  We  nodded  enthusiastical y,  but  on  leaving  the  station  I  asked Alberto, “Which one exactly is the murderer?” And his thinking was much the same as mine, that the dark guy had a much more murderous aspect than the Indian.  \\n In  the  long  hours  waiting  for  our  ride,  we  made  friends  with  someone  who  said  he  could arrange everything and that it would cost us nothing. True to his word, he spoke with a truck driver who agreed to take us. It turned out later, however, that he had merely organized that each of us would pay five   soles  less than the 20 per head the driver usual y charged. We pleaded that we were completely broke, which was only a few cents away from being the truth. He promised to meet the debt, and this he did, taking us home for the night as wel , after we arrived.  \\n The road was fairly narrow, though not nearly as bad as the previous one, and pretty, winding through forest or tropical fruit plantations: bananas, papayas and others. It climbed up and down the whole way to Oxapampa, some 1,000 meters above sea level, which was our destination and the end of the highway.  \\n Until this point we had been traveling in the same truck as the black guy who had reported the murder. At one of the stops along the road he bought us a meal and throughout it, lectured us on coffee,  papaya  and  the  black  slaves,  of  whom  his  grandfather  had  been  one.  He  said  this  quite openly but it you could detect a note of shame in his voice. In any case, Alberto and I agreed to absolve him of any guilt in the murder of his friend.  \\n ESPERANZA FALLIDA \\n shattered hopes \\n \\n With  great  disgust  we  learned  the  fol owing  morning  that  our Argentine  friend  had  given  us  bad information and his mother hadn’t lived in Oxapampa for quite a long time. A brother-in-law lived there instead, so he had to deal with our dead weight. The reception was magnificent and we had a big, improvised meal, but we soon realized that as guests we were only welcome out of traditional Peruvian courtesy. We decided to ignore everything besides express marching orders, seeing as we were completely out of money and had built up several days worth of hunger, and we could eat only consistently in the home of our disinclined friends.  \\n We  had  what  for  us  was  a  wonderful  day;  swimming  in  the  river,  letting  al   of  our  worries disappear, eating a lot of good food and drinking exquisite coffee. But al  good things sadly come \\n to an end and by nightfal  of the second day, the engineer (our “host” was an engineer) came up with a  formula  for  his  own  salvation  which  was  not  only  effective  but  particularly  cheap:  some  roads inspector had offered to take us al  the way to Lima. It seemed like a great idea to us as we were acutely feeling the restricted horizons and wanted to get to the capital to try and improve our luck. In other words, we fel  for it, hook, line and sinker.  \\n That  night  we  boarded  the  back  of  a  pickup  truck  which,  after  we  had  endured  a  violent downpour soaking us to our bones, dropped us at two in the morning in San Ramón, much less than even halfway to Lima. The driver said we should wait while he changed vehicles and to calm any suspicions he left his companion with us. After 10 minutes that guy went off to buy cigarettes, and at five in the morning this pair of Argentine wise guys breakfasted on the bitter realization that we had been taken for one long ride.  \\n Al  I hope is that the driver gets what he deserves, and that, if it wasn’t another one of his lies, the driver-come-toreador meets death on the horns of one of his bul s… (In the pit of my stomach I knew something was wrong but he seemed like such a nice person we believed everything… even the whole vehicle swap.) \\n Shortly  before  dawn,  we  came  across  a  couple  of  drunks  and  did  our  bril iant  “anniversary”  \\n routine. The technique is as fol ows: \\n 1.   Say something loudly, immediately identifiable as Argentine, something with a    che  in it and other  bits  of  slang  and  drawl.  The  candidate  takes  the  bait,  immediately  asking  where we’re from; we strike up a conversation.  \\n 2.   Begin to speak of the hardships but don’t make too much of them, al  the while maintaining a gaze fixed in the distance.  \\n 3.   I intervene and ask for the date; someone provides it and Alberto sighs, saying: “Imagine the coincidence, it was a year ago today.” The candidate asks, a year ago since what; we respond that it was when we began our journey.  \\n 4.   Alberto, much bolder than I am, lets out a gigantic sigh, saying, “Such a pity we’re in these dire  circumstances,  we  aren’t  able  to  celebrate”  (he  says  this  quietly,  as  if  confiding  in me). The candidate immediately offers to pay; we pretend to refuse for a while, admitting it would be impossible for us to ever pay him back, etc., and then final y, we accept the offer.  \\n 5.   After the first drink, I steadfastly refuse to accept another and Alberto makes a face at me.  \\n Our host becomes a little angry and insists, but I refuse, without giving reasons. The man asks and asks until I confess, ful  of embarrassment, that our custom in Argentina is to eat when we drink. Just how much we eat depends on how we judge the candidate’s face. Al in al , this is a highly refined technique.  \\n In San Ramón we tried it again and, as always, were able to concretize the enormous amount we had to drink with some solid food. In the morning we rested on the shores of the river — a very pretty \\n landscape even though its beauty escaped our aesthetic attentions somewhat, transforming itself into terrifying mirages of al  types of edible delicacies. Nearby, peeking through a fence, the plump forms of oranges materialized. Our feast was fierce and sad; in one minute our stomachs felt ful and acidy and in the next the stabbing of a severe hunger resumed.  \\n Famished,  we  decided  to  cast  off  the  little  shame  that  stubbornly  remained,  and  to  sort ourselves  out  at  the  local  hospital.  This  time  it  was  Alberto  who  was  overcome  with  a  strange timidity, and I had to find the right words to intone the fol owing diplomatic speech: \\n “Doctor”  —  we  found  one  in  the  hospital  —  “I  am  a  medical  student,  my  companion  is  a biochemist.  We  are  both  from  Argentina  and  we  are  hungry.  We  would  like  to  eat.”  In  such  a surprise  frontal  attack,  the  poor  doctor  could  do  nothing  but  agree  to  buy  us  a  meal  from  the restaurant where he himself ate. We were so brazen.  \\n Alberto was so ashamed he didn’t even thank him, and we set about fishing for another truck, which  we  eventual y  caught.  We  were  now  heading  to  Lima,  comfortably  instal ed  in  the  driver’s cabin, who now and then even paid for coffee.  \\n We were climbing the extremely narrow mountain road which had inspired such fear on the way in. The driver was happily relating the history of each and every cross lining the way, when suddenly he hit a huge hole in the middle of the road, visible to any fool. Our dread that the man didn’t know how to drive crept steadily higher, but elementary logic told us this wasn’t possible, that on this road anyone but the most experienced of drivers would have driven over the edge long ago. Tactful y and with patience, Alberto extracted the real story. The man had been in an accident which, according to him, had left his eyesight very poor, explaining why he hit so many potholes. We tried to make him understand  the  dangers  —  for  him,  and  for  the  people  traveling  with  him.  But  the  driver  was unyielding: this was his job, and he was paid very wel  by a boss who didn’t ask   how  he arrived, only  if  he arrived. Besides, his driving license had been very expensive, considering the decent bribe he’d had to pay to get it.  \\n The owner of the truck climbed on board a little further down the road. He seemed happy to take us to Lima but only if I, riding up top, would hide away when we came to police checkpoints because taking passengers on freight trucks like this one was prohibited. The owner also turned out to be a good person, giving us food al  the way to the capital. We passed through La Oroya before that, however, a mining town we dearly wanted to see, but we weren’t able to stop. La Oroya is at an altitude of some 4,000 meters, and from its unrefined appearance you can picture the hardship in a miner’s  life.  Its  tal   chimneys  throw  up  black  smoke,  impregnating  everything  with  soot,  and  the miners’ faces as they traveled the streets were also imbued with that ancient melancholy of smoke, unifying everything with its grayish monotone, a perfect coupling with the gray mountain days. We crossed  the  highest  point  on  the  road  while  it  was  stil   light,  at  4,853  meters  above  sea  level.  \\n Though it was stil  daytime, the cold was intense. Tucked up in my traveling blanket, staring out at the view extending on every side, I muttered al  sorts of verses, lul ed by the roar of the truck.  \\n \\n That night we slept just outside the city, and the fol owing day we made it early to Lima.  \\n LA CIUDAD DE LOS VIRREYES \\n the city of the viceroys \\n \\n We  were  at  the  end  of  one  of  the  most  important  stages  of  our  journey,  without  a  cent  or  much chance in the short term of making any money, but we were happy.  \\n Lima  is  a  pretty  city,  which  has  already  suppressed  its  colonial  past  (after  seeing  Cuzco  it seems more so) beneath new houses. Its fame as a precious jewel of a city is unjustified, but its residential suburbs are connected by wide avenues to the extremely agreeable resorts close to the sea. The people of Lima travel from the city to the port of Cal ao along various wide arterials in just a few minutes. The port has no special attraction (construction of al  ports seems to be completely standardized) save the fort, the scene of many battles. Alongside its enormous wal s we stood in wonder at Lord Cochrane’s extraordinary feat when, leading his Latin American sailors, he attacked and seized this bastion in one of the most celebrated episodes in the history of Latin America’s liberation.  \\n The  part  of  Lima  real y  worth  describing  is  the  city  center  around  its  wonderful  cathedral,  so different  from  that  heavy  monstrosity  in  Cuzco,  where  the  conquistadors  crudely  glorified themselves. There in Lima, the art is more stylized, with an almost effeminate touch: the cathedral towers are tal  and graceful, maybe the most slender of al  the cathedrals in the Spanish colonies.  \\n The lavishness of the woodwork in Cuzco has been left behind and taken up here in gold. The naves are light and airy, contrasting with those dark, hostile caverns of the Inca city. The paintings are also bright,  almost  joyous,  and  of  schools  more  recent  than  the  hermetic  mestizos,  who  painted  their saints  with  a  dark  and  captive  fury. Al   of  the  churches  convey  in  their  facades  and  altars  the  ful scope of Churrigueresque gold-embel ished art.* This vast wealth enabled the aristocracy to resist the liberating armies of America until the last moment. Lima is the perfect example of a Peru which has  not  developed  beyond  the  feudal  condition  of  a  colony.  It  stil   waits  for  the  blood  of  a  truly emancipating revolution.  \\n But there is a corner of the regal city which is most dear to us, and we went there frequently to relive our memories of Machu Picchu; this was the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. Don Julio Tel o was its creator, a pure blood Indian scholar. It contains extremely valuable col ections,  \\n synthesizing entire cultures.  \\n Lima is quite unlike Córdoba, but it has that same look of a colonial, or rather provincial, city.  \\n We visited the consulate, where letters awaited us and, after reading them, went to see what we could do with an introduction we had for a bureaucrat at the Foreign Office, who, of course, didn’t want to know us. We roamed from one police station to the next — until at one of them we got a plate  of  rice  —  and  in  the  afternoon  we  visited  Dr.  Hugo  Pesce,  the  expert  leprologist,  who welcomed  us  with  extraordinary  kindness  for  someone  at  the  head  of  such  a  wel -respected medical unit. He secured us lodging in the leprosy hospital and that night invited us to eat at his house. He turned out to be a fascinating conversationalist. It was very late when we got to bed.  \\n It was also very late when we got up and had breakfast. There was apparently no “order” to feed us, so we decided to go down to Cal ao and visit the port. The going was very slow because it was May 1 and there was no public transport; we had to do the whole 14 kilometers on foot. There was  nothing  in  particular  to  see  in  Cal ao,  much  less  any Argentine  boats.  More  bald-faced  than ever,  we  presented  ourselves  at  a  police  station  and  begged  a  bit  of  food,  then  beat  a  speedy retreat  back  to  Lima.  We  again  ate  at  Dr.  Pesce’s,  who  told  us  of  his  experiences  with  different types of leprosy.  \\n In the morning we went to the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. Incredible, but a lack of time meant we couldn’t see everything. The afternoon we dedicated to becoming familiar with the leprosy  hospital,*  with  a  guided  tour  by  Dr.  Molina,  who,  as  wel   as  being  a  good  leprologist,  is apparently an excel ent thoracic surgeon. As was our custom by then, we went to eat at Dr. Pesce’s.  \\n We lost the whole of Saturday morning in the city center trying to change 50 Swedish crowns; we succeeded final y after a bit of hustling. We spent the afternoon exploring the laboratory, which didn’t  have  much  worth  envying  and,  in  fact,  left  a  lot  to  be  desired.  The  bibliographic  records, however,  were  formidable  in  their  clarity  and  method  of  organization  and  also  in  their comprehensive detail. At night, of course, we were off to Dr. Pesce’s for dinner, and as always he proved his skil  in animated conversation.  \\n Sunday, an important day for us. Our first bul fight, and despite the fact that it went by the name of a   novillada , a fight with lesser standard bul s and toreadors, we were hugely excited; so much so that I almost couldn’t concentrate on one of Tel o’s books I was reading in the library that morning.  \\n We arrived as the bul fight was starting and just as we entered, a novitiate was kil ing the bul , but not in the normal way, by a coup de grâce.* As a result the bul  was suffering, laid out on the ground, while  the  toreador  tried  to  finish  it  off  and  the  public  shouted.  For  the  third  bul   there  was considerable excitement when it spectacularly hooked the toreador and threw him to the air, but that was it. The fiesta closed with the almost unnoticed death of the sixth bul . Art, I see none; courage, a certain level; skil , not much; excitement, relative. In summary, it al  depends what there is to do on a Sunday.  \\n On  Monday  morning  we  again  went  to  the  museum.  In  the  evening,  to  Dr.  Pesce’s  house,  \\n where  we  met  a  professor  of  psychiatry,  Dr.  Valenza,  another  good  talker  who  told  us  war anecdotes and others much like the fol owing: “The other day I went to our local cinema to see a film with Cantinflas.** Everyone laughed but I understood nothing. This was not so strange; the rest of the people couldn’t understand anything either. So, why were they laughing? In reality, they laugh at themselves, each one of them was laughing at a part of themselves. We’re a young country, without tradition or culture, we’ve barely been discovered. And so they laugh at al  the blights our infantile civilization  has  not  been  able  to  fix…  But  now  then,  has  North America  ful y  matured,  despite  its skyscrapers, its cars, its good fortune? Has it left its youth behind? No, the differences are in form only, they are not fundamental; al  America is a sister in this. Watching Cantinflas, I understood Pan-Americanism!”  \\n Tuesday saw no change — in terms of museum visits — but at three in the afternoon we met with  Dr.  Pesce  who  gave Alberto  a  white  suit  and  myself  a  jacket  of  the  same  color.  Everyone concurs — we almost look human. The rest of the day was of no real importance.  \\n Several days have passed and we have one foot in the stirrup, but remain uncertain as to when we wil  be leaving. We were supposed to leave two days ago, but the truck that is to take us hasn’t left  yet.  The  many  parts  that  make  up  our  journey  are  going  wel .  In  terms  of  furthering  our knowledge, we visit museums and libraries. But the only one that real y matters is the Archaeology and Anthropology Museum, founded by Dr. Tel o. From a scientific perspective, leprosy that is, we have  met  Dr.  Pesce;  the  others  are  merely  his  disciples  and  have  a  long  way  to  go  before producing  anything  worthwhile.  Because  there  are  no  biochemists  in  Peru,  the  lab  is  run  by specialist doctors and Alberto has spoken with some of them, putting them in touch with people in Buenos  Aires.  He  got  on  wel   with  two  of  them  but  the  third  person…  Wel ,  Alberto  introduced himself as Dr. Granado, specialist in leprosy, etc., and they took him to be a medical doctor. So this sil y guy he questioned, responded with: “No, there are no biochemists here. Just as there’s a law prohibiting doctors from establishing pharmacies, we don’t let pharmacists interfere in things they don’t understand.” Alberto was ready to get violent so I gave him a gentle nudge and this dissuaded him.  \\n In spite of its simplicity, one of the things which left a very strong impression on us in Lima was the way the hospital patients farewel ed us. They had al  chipped in 100½   soles , which they gave to us along with an effusive letter. Afterwards some of them came to say goodbye to us personal y and in more than one case tears were shed as they thanked us for the little bit of life we’d given them.  \\n We shook their hands, accepted their gifts, and sat with them listening to footbal  on the radio. If there’s  anything  that  wil   make  us  seriously  dedicate  ourselves  to  leprosy,  it  wil   be  the  affection shown to us by al  the sick we’ve met along the way.  \\n Lima  as  a  city  does  not  live  up  to  its  long  tradition  as  a  viceregal  seat,  but  its  residential suburbs are very pretty and spacious and so are its new streets. An interesting fact was the number of  police  surrounding  the  Colombian  embassy.  There  were  no  less  than  50  uniformed  and \\n plainclothes policemen doing permanent guard duty around the entire block.  \\n The first day’s journey out of Lima was unremarkable. We saw the road up to La Oroya and the rest we traveled during the night, arriving at Cerro de Pasco at dawn. We traveled in the company of the Becerra brothers, who we cal ed Cambalache* or Camba for short. They turned out to be very good people, especial y the older one. We continued driving al  day, descending into more pleasant places, and the headache and general feeling of il -health I’d had since Ticlio, at 4,853 meters the highest point above sea level, started to improve. As we passed Huánuco and approached Tingo María, the front left axle broke, but luckily the wheel became stuck in the mudguard so we didn’t turn over. That night we had to stay put. I needed to give myself an injection, but as luck would have it, the syringe broke.  \\n The next day was uneventful and asthmatic, but that night fortune turned our way when Alberto mentioned  in  a  melancholic  voice  that  today,  May  20,  was  the  six-month  anniversary  of  our departure. That was the pretext for the   pisco  to flow. By the third bottle, Alberto stumbled to his feet, abandoned a little monkey he’d been holding in his arms, and disappeared from the scene. The younger Camba continued for another half a bottle, and crashed on the spot.  \\n We left in a hurry the next morning, before the woman who owned the place woke up, because we hadn’t paid the bil  and the Camba brothers were short on cash because of repairs to the axle.  \\n We drove the whole day until ending up stuck at one of those road barriers the army puts up to stop people traveling when its raining heavily.  \\n Off again the next day and we were detained once more at a barrier. Only in the evening did they let us move on, yet we were stopped again at a smal  town cal ed Nescuil a, our final stop for the day.  \\n The road was stil  closed the next day, so we went to the army post to get some food. We left in the afternoon, taking with us a wounded soldier who would get us through the army roadblocks. The strategy worked: a few kilometers down the road, when the rest of the trucks were being stopped, ours was al owed through to Pucal pa where we arrived after nightfal . The younger Camba paid for our meal and to say goodbye we drank four bottles of wine that made him sentimental and promise us his eternal love. He then paid for a hotel room for us to sleep in.  \\n The main task at hand was getting to Iquitos, so we concentrated on that. The first person we hit on was the mayor, someone cal ed Cohen; we had heard a lot about him, that he was Jewish as far as money was concerned but a good sort. There was no doubt he was tightfisted; the problem was whether he was a good sort. He palmed us off to the shipping agents, who in turn sent us to speak with the captain, who was kindly enough, promising the huge concession of charging us third-class fares and letting us travel in first. We weren’t happy with this, and went to see the head of the garrison who said he couldn’t do anything for us. Then the second-in-command, after interrogating us (and in doing so demonstrating his stupidity), promised to help.  \\n \\n We went for a swim that afternoon in the Ucayali River which looks a lot like the Upper Paraná.  \\n We came across the deputy, who said he’d secured a great deal for us: as a special favor to him, the captain had agreed to charge us third-class fares and let us travel in first. Big deal.  \\n There was a very rare pair of fish where we swam, cal ed by the locals   bufeo . Legend has it that they eat men, rape women and commit a thousand other acts of violence. Apparently it’s a river dolphin, which among other strange characteristics, has genitals similar to those of a woman. So, the Indians use it as a substitute, but they must kil  the animal once they’ve finished coitus because the genital area contracts and the penis cannot come out. That night we took on the ever arduous task of facing our col eagues at the hospital to ask for lodging. As expected, they greeted us coldly, and would have turned us away had our equanimity not won them over and we were given two beds where we could rest our weary bones.  \\n \\n *Spanish baroque architecture, characterized by elaborate surface decoration.  \\n *The Hospital de Guía.  \\n *In Spanish,   descabellar:  to sever the bull’s spinal cord with a dagger.  \\n **Cantinflas was a prolific Mexican comic actor — a Mexican Charlie Chaplin.  \\n *Spanish for bric a brac, or junk store.  \\n UCAYALI ABAJO \\n down the ucayali \\n \\n Carrying our packs, looking like explorers, we boarded the little boat   La Cenepa  just before it left.  \\n As  agreed,  the  captain  let  us  into  first  class  where  we  quickly  mingled  with  al   the  privileged passengers. After a few whistles, the boat pul ed away from shore and so began the second stage in  our  journey  to  San  Pablo.  When  we  could  no  longer  see  the  houses  of  Pucal pa  and  al   that remained was a steady panorama of unbroken jungle, people began to leave the rails and gathered around the gambling tables. We approached with caution but Alberto was struck with momentary inspiration  and  won  90   soles   at  a  card  game  cal ed  “21,”  very  much  like  our  “7½.”  This  victory brought upon us the loathing of the other gamblers, because he had played with an initial stake of just one   sol  of the national currency.  \\n On  that  first  day  we  didn’t  have  many  opportunities  for  friendly  exchanges  with  the  other passengers and we kept somewhat to ourselves, not getting involved in the general conversation.  \\n The food was scarce and poor. The boat didn’t sail at night because the river was too low. There were hardly any mosquitoes, and even though we were told this was normal we didn’t real y believe it, because by now we were used to the exaggerations (and understatements) people make when trying to deal with difficult situations.  \\n Early  the  next  morning,  we  were  off.  The  day  passed  uneventful y,  except  for  making  friends with a girl who seemed rather easy; maybe she thought we had a few   pesos   despite  the  diligent tears we wept whenever there was any mention of money. Toward evening, when the boat docked by the riverbank, the mosquitoes came out in hordes to prove the tangible truth of their existence, attacking  us  in  swarms  throughout  the  night.  Alberto  covered  his  face  with  a  piece  of  net  and wrapped in his sleeping bag was able to get some sleep, but I began to feel the symptoms of an asthma attack, so between that and the mosquitoes, I didn’t close my eyes until the morning. That night  has  escaped  from  my  memory,  but  I  do  stil   remember  feeling  the  skin  on  my  butt  that  had taken on gigantic proportions from so many bites. I was sleepy the whole next day and stayed in some corner or other, trying to snatch a few winks in borrowed hammocks. My asthma showed no sign  of  abating  and  I  had  to  take  the  drastic  measure  of  getting  asthma  medicine  by  the  banal method of paying for it. It relieved the attack slightly. We looked out dreamily beyond the river edge to  the  jungle,  its  inviting  greenery  so  mysterious.  My  asthma  and  the  mosquitoes  restrained  me somewhat, but virgin forests are so compel ing for spirits like ours that physical impediments and al the nascent forces of nature only served to stimulate my desire.  \\n The  days  passed  with  great  monotony.  The  only  form  of  entertainment  was  the  game  we couldn’t enjoy ful y because of our economic situation. Two more days went by uneventful y. This trip would normal y take four days but the river was so low we had to stop every night; this delayed the journey and turned us into promising targets for the mosquitoes. Although the food is better in first class and the threat from mosquitoes less vicious, I’m not sure what we won in the bargain. We are drawn more to the simple sailors than to that smal  middle class which, whether rich or not, is too attached to the memory of what it once was to al ow themselves the luxury of associating with two penniless travelers. They have the same crass ignorance as any other man, but the smal  victories they have achieved in life have gone to their heads, and their dul  opinions are delivered with even more  arrogance  simply  because  they  themselves  have  tendered  them.  My  asthma  worsened, though I was fol owing my diet strictly.  \\n A  careless  caress  from  that  easy  girl  who  showed  sympathy  for  my  pathetic  physical  state penetrated the dormant memories of my preadventurer life. That night as I was kept awake by the mosquitoes,  I  thought  of  Chichina,  now  a  distant,  intoxicating  dream;  though  the  dream’s  ending, unusual for this kind of naive reminiscing, leaves more honey than bitterness in my memory. I sent her a soft and unhurried kiss, that of an old friend who knows and understands her; then my mind took a road to Malagueño, that great hal  of so many sleepless nights, where at that very moment \\n she would probably be whispering her strange, composed phrases to some new suitor.  \\n My eyes traced the immense vault of heaven; the starry sky twinkled happily above me, as if answering in the affirmative to the question rising deep within me: “Is al  of this worth it?”  \\n Two more days: nothing changed. The confluence of the Ucayali and the Marañon that gives birth  to  the  earth’s  mightiest  river  has  nothing  transcendent  about  it:  it  is  simply  two  masses  of muddy water that unite to form one — a bit wider, maybe a bit deeper, but nothing else. I had no more adrenalin and my asthma was getting worse; I could eat only a handful of rice and drink   mate .  \\n On the last day, close to arriving, we ran into a severe storm which meant we had to stop the boat.  \\n The mosquitoes swarmed around us in clouds, worse than ever, as if taking their revenge on us for the fact we would soon be out of their reach. It felt like a night without end, fil ed with frantic slaps and edgy yelps, endless card games like narcotics and with random phrases tossed out to maintain any conversation and pass the time more quickly. In the morning, the fever of disembarking leaves one  hammock  lying  empty  and  I  lie  down. As  if  enchanted,  I  felt  as  though  a  coiled  spring  was unwinding inside me, taking me to new heights, or into an abyss, I don’t know which… Alberto woke me with a rough shake. “ Pelao ,* we’ve arrived.” The river had broadened to reveal in front of us a low-lying town with some tal er buildings, surrounded by jungle and reddened by the earth beneath them.  \\n It was a Sunday, and the day of our arrival in Iquitos. We docked early at the pier and went directly  to  speak  with  the  head  of  the  International  Cooperation  Service.  We  did  have  an introduction to Dr. Chávez Pastor, but he was not in Iquitos. They were kind to us anyway, putting us up in the ward for yel ow fever and giving us hospital food. My asthma was stil  bad and I couldn’t get on top of my miserable wheezing, even with up to four injections of adrenalin a day.  \\n The next day I felt no better and I spent it passed out in bed, or rather “adrenalizing myself.”  \\n The fol owing day I resolved to fol ow a strict morning diet and a more or less strict one at night, cutting  out  rice.  I  improved  a  little,  though  not  much. At  night,  we  watched  “Stromboli”  with  Ingrid Bergman, and Rossel ini as the director. You cannot give it any other rating besides bad.  \\n Wednesday marked a distinctly important date for us with the announcement that we would be leaving  the  next  day.  The  news  made  us  significantly  happier,  since  I  had  been  unable  to  move because of my asthma and we spent days col apsed in bed.  \\n Very  early  the  next  day  we  began  to  prepare  psychological y  to  leave.  The  day  passed, however,  and  we  were  stil   anchored;  it  was  announced  that  departure  would  be  the  fol owing afternoon.  \\n Confident that the owners’ inertia could have us leaving later but never before time, we slept soundly. After taking a walk we went to the library, where the assistant, extremely agitated, rushed in to  tel   us  that   El Cisne   was  sailing  at  11:30  a.m.  It  was  already  11:05.  We  gathered  our  things together quickly and, because I was stil  suffering from asthma, took a taxi which charged us half a \\n \\n Peruvian   libra  for Iquitos’ eight blocks. We reached the boat and discovered it wasn’t leaving until three, though it was required that we board by one. We weren’t brave enough to disobey and go to eat at the hospital and, at any rate, it was more convenient not to, because now we could “forget”  \\n the syringe they had loaned us. We ate terrible and expensive food with an Indian belonging to the Yagua tribe, strangely attired in a red straw skirt and a few necklaces of the same straw; his name was Benjamín but he spoke almost no Spanish. Just above his left shoulder blade he had a scar from a bul et shot at almost point-blank range, because of “ vinganza ,”* according to him.  \\n The  night  was  brimming  with  mosquitoes  fighting  over  our  almost  virgin  flesh.  There  was  an important addition to our psychological perspective in that trip when we learned it was possible to get  from  Manaos  to  Venezuela  by  river.  The  next  day  passed  calmly,  and  we  slept  as  much  as possible  to  recover  the  sleep  lost  to  the  hording  mosquitoes.  That  night,  at  about  1  a.m.,  I  was woken just seconds after I’d fal en asleep and told we had arrived in San Pablo. They advised the colony’s  medical  director,  Dr.  Bresciani,  who  was  very  welcoming  and  facilitated  a  room  for  the night.  \\n \\n *Slang for “baldy.”  \\n *A mix of Spanish and Portuguese for the word, “revenge.”  \\n QUERIDO PAPI \\n dear papi \\n \\n   Iquitos \\n   June 4, 1952 \\n The  great  riverbanks  are  ful   of  settlements.  To  find  savage  tribes  you  must  fol ow  the  tributaries deep  into  the  interior  —  and,  this  time  at  least,  we  don’t  intend  to  make  that  journey.  Infectious diseases  have  disappeared,  but  just  in  case,  we’ve  been  vaccinated  against  typhoid  and  yel ow fever and have good supplies of atebrine and quinine.  \\n There are many diseases caused by metabolic disorders: the food available in the jungle is nutritional y inadequate, but you only become seriously il  by going without vitamins for over a week, and  even  if  we  went  by  river  that’s  the  longest  period  of  time  we  would  be  without  proper  food.  \\n We’re stil  not sure about this and have been looking into the possibility of flying to Bogotá, or at \\n \\n least to Leguisamo, as the roads are good from there on. It’s not that we think it might be dangerous to travel by river, but we can save money, which later on might be important for me.  \\n Away  from  the  scientific  centers  where  we  risk  being  exposed,  our  journey  becomes something of an event for the staff of the leprosy hospitals and they shower us with the respect due to two visiting researchers. I’ve become real y interested in leprology, but I don’t know how long it wil  last. The patients in the Lima hospital farewel ed us so wonderful y we were encouraged to carry on; they gave us a gas camping stove and managed to col ect 100   soles , which for them in their economic  situation  counts  as  a  fortune.  Some  of  them  had  tears  in  their  eyes  when  they  said goodbye.  Their  appreciation  sprang  from  the  fact  that  we  never  wore  overal s  or  gloves,  that  we shook their hands as we would shake anybody’s, that we sat with them, talking about al  sorts of things,  that  we  played  footbal   with  them.  It  may  al   seem  like  pointless  bravado,  but  the psychological lift it gives to these poor people — treating them as normal human beings instead of animals, as they are used to — is incalculable and the risk to us extremely low. Until today the only staff to have become infected are a medical orderly in Indochina who lived with his patients, and an overly zealous monk I would not like to vouch for.  \\n LA COLONIA DE SAN PABLO \\n the san pablo leper colony \\n \\n The fol owing day, Sunday, we were up and ready to visit the colony, but to get there you have to go by  river  and,  as  it  wasn’t  a  working  day,  we  couldn’t  go.  So  we  visited  the  administrator  of  the colony, a butch-looking nun cal ed Sister Alberto, then played a game of footbal  in which the two of us performed very badly. My asthma began to recede.  \\n On Monday we sent a good proportion of our clothes to be washed, then went to the colony to visit the patients’ compound. There are 600 sick people living independently in typical jungle huts, doing whatever they choose, looking after themselves, in an organization which has developed a rhythm  and  style  of  its  own.  There  is  a  local  official,  a  judge,  a  policeman,  etc.  The  respect  Dr.  \\n Bresciani commands is considerable and he clearly coordinates the whole colony, both protecting and sorting out disputes that arise between the different groups.  \\n On  Tuesday  we  visited  the  colony  again,  joining  Dr.  Bresciani  as  he  made  his  rounds, examining  the  patients’  nervous  systems.  He  is  preparing  a  detailed  study  of  nervous  forms  of \\n \\n leprosy based on 400 cases. It real y is very interesting work because many of the cases of leprosy in this region attack the nervous system. Actual y, I didn’t see a single patient who wasn’t presenting such  symptoms.  Bresciani  told  us  that  Dr.  Souza  Lima  was  interested  in  early  signs  of  nervous disorder among the children living in the colony.  \\n We  went  to  the  part  of  the  colony  reserved  for  the  healthy,  where  70  or  so  people  live.  It  is lacking  basic  amenities  that  are  supposedly  being  instal ed,  like  electricity  during  the  day,  a refrigerator  and  even  a  laboratory.  They  are  in  need  of  a  good  microscope,  a  microtome,  a technician  —  at  the  moment  this  post  is  occupied  by  Mother  Margarita,  nice  but  not  very knowledgeable — and they need a surgeon to operate on nerves, eyes, etc. An interesting thing is that aside from the widespread nervous problems, there are very few blind people, perhaps leading to the conclusion that [indecipherable word] has something to do with it, seeing that most receive no treatment at al .  \\n We  repeated  our  rounds  on  Wednesday,  passing  the  day  with  fishing  and  swimming  in between.  I  played  chess  with  Dr.  Bresciani  at  night,  or  we  chatted.  Dr.  Alfaro,  the  dentist,  is  a wonderful  person  —  relaxed  and  very  friendly.  Thursday  is  a  day  of  rest  for  the  colony  so  we changed our routine, not visiting the compound. We tried to fish, without success, in the morning. In the  afternoon  we  played  footbal   and  my  performance  in  goal  was  less  atrocious.  On  Friday  I returned to the compound, but Alberto stayed to do bacil oscopes in the company of that sweet nun, Mother  Margarita.  I  caught  two  species  of   sumbi   fish,  cal ed   mota ,  and  gave  one  of  them  to  Dr.  \\n Montoya to enjoy.  \\n EL DÍA DE SAN GUEVARA \\n saint guevara’s day \\n \\n On  Saturday,  June  14,  1952,  I,  just  a  lad,  turned  24,  on  the  cusp  of  that  transcendental  quarter century, silver wedding of a life, which, al  things considered, has not treated me so badly. Early in the morning I went to the river, to try my luck again with the fish, but that sport is like gambling: one starts out winning and ends up losing. In the afternoon we played footbal  and I occupied my usual place  in  goal,  with  better  results  than  on  earlier  occasions.  In  the  evening,  after  passing  by  Dr.  \\n Bresciani’s  house  for  a  delightful,  huge  meal,  they  threw  a  party  for  us  in  the  dining  room  of  the colony,  with  a  lot  of  the  Peruvian  national  drink,   pisco . Alberto  is  quite  experienced  regarding  its effects on the central nervous system. With everyone slightly drunk and in high spirits, the colony’s \\n director toasted us warmly, and I, “ piscoed ,” replied with something elaborate, like the fol owing: Well, it’s my duty to respond to the toast offered by Dr. Bresciani with something more than a conventional gesture. In our presently precarious state as travelers, we only have recourse to words and I would now like to use them to express my thanks, and those of my traveling   compañero , to all of the staff of the colony who, almost without knowing us, have given us this beautiful demonstration of their affection, celebrating my birthday as if it were an intimate celebration for one of your own. But there is something more. Within a few days we will be leaving Peruvian territory, so these words have the secondary intention of being a farewell, and I would like to stress our gratitude to all the people of this country, who have unfailingly shown us their warmest hospitality since we entered Peru via Tacna.  \\n I would also like to say something else, unrelated to the theme of this toast. Although our insignificance means we can’t be spokespeople for such a noble cause, we believe, and after this journey more firmly than ever, that the division of [Latin] America into unstable and illusory nations is completely fictional. We constitute a single mestizo race, which from Mexico to the Magellan Straits bears notable ethnographical similarities. And so, in an attempt to rid myself of the weight of small-minded provincialism, I propose a toast to Peru and to a United Latin America.  \\n \\n My  oratory  offering  was  received  with  great  applause.  The  party,  consisting  in  these  parts  of drinking as much alcohol as possible, continued until three in the morning, when we final y cal ed it a day.  \\n On Sunday morning we visited a tribe of Yaguas, the Indians of the red straw. After a 30-minute walk along a path, disproving al  rumors of dense, impenetrable jungle, we reached a group of huts where  a  family  lived.  Their  way  of  living  was  fascinating  —  outside,  beneath  wooden  planks  and with  tiny,  hermetic  palm  frond  huts  to  shelter  in  at  night  from  the  mosquitoes  that  attack  in  close formation.  The  women  had  abandoned  traditional  costume  for  ordinary  clothes  so  you  couldn’t admire their jugs. The kids have distended bel ies and are rather scrawny but the older people show no signs of vitamin deficiency, in contrast with its rate among more developed people living in the jungle. Their basic diet consists of yucca, bananas and palm fruit, mixed with the animals they hunt with rifles. Their teeth are total y rotten. They speak their own dialect but some of them understand Spanish.  \\n In the afternoon we played footbal  and though I played better they got a sneaky goal past me.  \\n That night Alberto woke me with an acute stomach pain, which later was located in the right iliac cavity; I was too exhausted to preoccupy myself with someone else’s strange aches so I advised him to resign himself to the pain, turned over and slept through til  the next day.  \\n Monday, the day medicine is distributed throughout the compound. Alberto, wel  cared for by his dear Mother Margarita, was receiving penicil in religiously every four hours. Dr. Bresciani told me he was waiting for a raft to arrive with some animals, and that we could take some planks and make a smal  raft of our own. The idea inspired us and we started making plans to go to Manaos, etc. I had an infected foot, so I missed the afternoon game and instead chatted with Dr. Bresciani about everything imaginable and fel  into bed very late.  \\n Tuesday morning, with Alberto ful y recovered, we went to the compound where Dr. Montoya had operated on the ulna in a leprous nervous system with apparently bril iant results, although the technique left much to be desired. We went to fish in the afternoon in a nearby lagoon, and caught nothing, of course; but on the way back I determined to swim across the Amazon. It took me nearly two hours to the great despair of Dr. Montoya who had no desire to wait so long. That night there was  a  jovial  little  party,  ending  in  a  serious  fight  with  Señor  Lezama  Beltrán,  an  immature, introverted soul who was probably a pervert as wel . The poor man was drunk and irate because he had not been invited to the party, so he started shouting insults and raving until someone punched him in the eye and gave him a beating as wel . The episode upset us a little because the poor man, apart  from  being  homosexual  and  a  first-rate  bore,  had  been  very  nice  to  us,  giving  us  10   soles  each, bringing our total to 479 for me and 163½ to Alberto.  \\n Wednesday  dawned  with  rain,  so  we  didn’t  go  to  the  compound  and  the  day  was  general y wasted. I read some García Lorca, and we went to see the raft tying up at the jetty. On Thursday morning, the day the medical staff have off, we went with Dr. Montoya to the opposite bank to buy food. We traveled down a branch of the Amazon, bought papayas, yucca, maize, fish, sugarcane at incredibly cheap prices, and fished a little. Montoya caught a regular fish and I got a   mota . Coming back, a strong wind stirred up the river and the captain, Roger Álvarez, nearly wet his pants as the waves flooded his canoe. I asked for the rudder but he refused to give it to me and we went to the bank to wait for the river to calm down. Not until three in the afternoon did we get home. We cooked the fish but it didn’t ful y satisfy our hunger. Roger gave each of us a shirt and me a pair of pants, so my spiritual wel -being improved.  \\n The raft was almost ready, only needing oars. That night an assembly of the colony’s patients gave us a farewel  serenade, with lots of local songs sung by a blind man. The orchestra was made up  of  a  flute  player,  a  guitarist  and  an  accordion  player  with  almost  no  fingers,  and  a  “healthy”  \\n contingent helping out with a saxophone, a guitar and some percussion. After that came the time for speeches, in which four patients spoke as wel  as they could, a little awkwardly. One of them froze, unable  to  go  on,  until  out  of  desperation  he  shouted,  “Three  cheers  for  the  doctors!” Afterwards, Alberto  thanked  them  warmly  for  their  welcome,  saying  that  Peru’s  natural  beauty  could  not compare with the emotional beauty of this moment, that he had been deeply touched, that he could say no more except… and here he extended his arms with Perón-like gesture and intonation, “I want to give my thanks to al  of you.”  \\n The patients cast off and to the sound of a folk tune the human cargo drifted away from shore; the  tenuous  light  of  their  lanterns  giving  the  people  a  ghostly  quality.  We  went  to  Dr.  Bresciani’s house for a few drinks, and after chatting for a while, to bed.  \\n Friday was our day of departure, so in the morning we paid a farewel  visit to the patients and, after  taking  a  few  photos,  came  back  carrying  two  fine  pineapples,  a  gift  from  Dr.  Montoya.  We bathed and ate, and close to three in the afternoon began to say our goodbyes. At half past three \\n \\n our raft, christened the   Mambo-Tango , set off downstream carrying a crew of both of us, and also for a while Dr. Bresciani, Alfaro and Chávez who built the raft.  \\n They took us out into the middle of the river and left us to fend for ourselves.  \\n LA KONTIKITA SE REVELA \\n debut for the little kontiki \\n \\n Two or three mosquitoes alone could not beat my desire to sleep and within a few minutes it had defeated them. My triumph was empty, however, as Alberto’s voice shook me from my delicious state of limbo. The faint lights of a little town, which from its appearance had to be Leticia, could be seen on the left bank of the river. What fol owed was the hugely arduous task of directing the raft toward the lights, and in this, we met with disaster: the contraption refused to go anywhere near the bank; intransigent, it was determined to set its own course down the middle of the river. We rowed at ful  strength and just when it seemed we were definitely on our way, we’d turn a half circle and head  back  into  midstream.  We  watched  with  growing  desperation  as  the  lights  drifted  into  the distance. Exhausted, we decided that at least we could win the fight against the mosquitoes and sleep peaceful y until dawn, deciding what to do then. Our prospects were not very promising. If we continued  down  river  we’d  have  to  go  as  far  as  Manaos,  a  long  way  according  to  more  or  less reliable information, some 10 days’ sailing. Due to an accident the day before, we didn’t have any more fishing hooks, nor any great quantities of essential provisions, and we weren’t sure we could make it to the bank when we wanted to. Not to mention the fact that we’d entered Brazil without our papers in order and couldn’t speak the language… But these concerns didn’t worry us for too long, because very quickly we fel  into a deep sleep. The rising sun woke me and I crawled out from under the mosquito net to determine our position. With the world’s worst intentions, our little   Kontiki   had deposited itself on the right bank of the river, and was calmly waiting at a kind of little jetty belonging to a nearby house. I decided to put off inspecting things until later because the mosquitoes were stil within eating range and were enjoying their feast. Alberto was sleeping deeply so I thought I’d join him and do the same. A morbid fatigue and an uneasy exhaustion overwhelmed me. I felt incapable of making any decision but clung to the thought that no matter how bad things became, there was no reason to suppose we couldn’t handle it.  \\n \\n QUERIDA VIEJA \\n dear mama \\n \\n   Bogotá, Colombia \\n   July 6, 1952 \\n   Dear Mama ,  \\n Here  I  am;  my  travels  have  taken  me  a  few  kilometers  closer  to  Venezuela  and  made  me  a  few  pesos   poorer.  First,  let  me  wish  you  the  important  happy  birthday;  I  hope  it  was  spent  with  love, laughter  and  the  family.  Next,  I’l   be  organized  and  give  you  a  concise  account  of  my  adventures since we left Iquitos. We set off more or less according to plan; traveling for two nights with our loyal retinue  of  mosquitoes  and  arriving  in  the  San  Pablo  colony  at  dawn,  where  we  obtained accommodation. The medical director, a marvel ous guy, liked us immediately and we got on wel with the whole colony general y, except the nuns who questioned why we never went to mass. These nuns ran the place and those who didn’t attend mass had their rations reduced (we went without, but the  kids  there  helped  us  and  found  us  food  every  day). Apart  from  this  minor  cold  war,  life  was incredibly pleasant. On the 14th, they gave me a party with lots of   pisco , a kind of gin which makes you wonderful y drunk. The director of the colony toasted us and, inspired by the booze, I replied with a  quintessential y  Pan-American  speech,  winning  great  applause  from  the  notable,  and  notably drunk, audience. We stayed a bit longer than planned, but final y left for Colombia. On the last night, a group of patients came over from the colony in a large canoe; they sang us farewel  serenades on the jetty and made some very touching speeches. Alberto, who believes he is Perón’s natural heir, delivered  such  an  impressive,  demagogic  speech  that  our  wel -wishers  were  convulsed  with laughter. It was one of the most interesting experiences of our trip. An accordion player who had no fingers on his right hand used little sticks tied to his wrist; the singer was blind; and almost al  the others were horribly deformed, due to the nervous form of the disease very common in this area.  \\n With light from the lamps and the lanterns reflected in the river, it was like a scene from a horror movie.  The  place  is  lovely,  surrounded  completely  by  jungle,  with  indigenous  tribes  barely  a  mile away  (whom  we  visited,  of  course),  and  a  lot  of  fish  and  game  to  eat  and  incalculable  potential wealth;  al   of  this  set  us  dreaming  of  crossing  the  Mato  Grosso  by  river,  from  Paraguay  to  the Amazon,  practising  medicine  along  the  way,  and  so  on…  a  dream  kind  of  like  having  your  own \\n home… perhaps one day… We were feeling more like authentic explorers and set sail downstream on  a  luxury  raft  they  built  especial y  for  us.  The  first  day  went  smoothly  but  that  night,  instead  of keeping watch as we should have done, we both settled down to sleep, comfortably protected by a mosquito  net  we’d  been  given,  and  woke  up  the  next  morning  to  find  we’d  run  aground  on  the riverbank.  \\n We ate like sharks. That day passed cheerful y and we decided to take turns at keeping watch, by the hour, to avoid any more problems, since at dusk the current had carried us toward the bank and  some  half-submerged  branches  nearly  caused  the  raft  to  capsize.  I  earned  a  demerit  point during one of my watches, when one of the hens we were taking to eat fel  into the river and the current swept it away. The man who had swum the ful  width of the river in San Pablo didn’t have the courage to dive in after it, partly because we’d seen al igators surfacing every now and then, and partly because I’ve never real y overcome my fear of water at night. If you’d been there you would have  pul ed  it  out  and  saved  the  chicken,  so  would  Ana  María,  since  you  don’t  have  ridiculous nighttime complexes like me.  \\n One of our hooks caught the most enormous fish and we had a hard time hauling it on board.  \\n We kept watch til  morning, when we moored at the bank and then crawled under the mosquito net, as there were particularly vicious mosquitoes about. After a good sleep, Alberto, who prefers fish to chicken, discovered our two baited hooks had vanished during the night, which put him in an even fouler mood. As there was a house nearby, we decided to find out how far it was to Leticia. When the owner told us in formal Portuguese that Leticia was seven hours upstream and that we were now in Brazil, Alberto and I had a furious argument over who had fal en asleep on watch. But this got us nowhere. We gave the owner the fish and a pineapple weighing about four kilos given to us by the lepers and stayed overnight in his house, before he took us up-river again. The return trip was quite fast, but hard work because we had to row for at least seven hours in a canoe and we weren’t used  to  it.  We  found  board  and  lodging,  etc.,  at  the  police  station  in  Leticia;  but  we  couldn’t  get more than 50 percent off our airfares, and had to fork out 130 Colombian   pesos , plus another 15 for excess baggage, making a total of 1,500 Argentine   pesos  in al . But what saved the day was that we  were  asked  to  coach  a  footbal   team  while  waiting  for  the  plane,  which  came  only  once  a fortnight. At  first,  we  only  intended  to  coach  them  to  the  point  where  they  wouldn’t  make  fools  of themselves; but they were so bad we decided to play, too. The amazing result was that what was considered the weakest team entered the one-day championship utterly reorganized, made it to the final and lost only on penalties. Alberto looked vaguely like Pedernera* with his spot-on passes, so he was nicknamed Pedernerita, in fact, and I saved a penalty which wil  go down in the history of Leticia. The whole celebration would have been great if they hadn’t played the Colombian national anthem  at  the  end  and  I  hadn’t  bent  down  to  wipe  some  blood  off  my  knee  during  it,  sparking  a violent reaction from the colonel, who shouted at me. I was just on the edge of shouting back when I remembered  our  journey,  etc.,  and  bit  my  tongue. After  a  great  flight  in  a  cocktail-shaker  of  an airplane, we arrived in Bogotá. Alberto chatted to the other passengers on the way, recounting an \\n awful flight we’d had across the Atlantic once when attending an international leprosy conference in Paris, and how three of the four engines had failed and we’d been within minutes of crashing into the  Atlantic,  concluding  with,  “Honestly,  these  Douglases…”;  he  was  so  convincing  I  was  even scared myself.  \\n We feel like we’ve been around the world twice. Our first day in Bogotá went pretty wel , we found  food  on  the  university  campus  but  no  accommodation  because  it  was  ful   of  students  on grants for courses organized by the United Nations. No Argentines, of course. Just after one in the morning we final y found space at the hospital, by which I mean a chair to spend the night in. We’re not  terribly  poor,  but  explorers  with  our  history  and  stature  would  rather  die  than  pay  for  the bourgeois  comfort  of  a  hostel.  After  that  the  leprosy  service  took  us  in,  even  though  they  had regarded us with suspicion the first day because of the letter of introduction we brought from Peru \\n —  very  complimentary  but  signed  by  Dr.  Pesce,  who  plays  in  the  same  position  as  Lusteau.** \\n Alberto shoved various certificates under their noses and they hardly had time to catch their breath before  I  cornered  them  about  my  al ergy  work,  leaving  them  reeling.  The  result?  We  were  both offered jobs. I had no intention of accepting but Alberto, for obvious reasons, was considering it. I had been using Roberto’s knife to sketch something on the ground in the street, and consequently we had an altercation with the police who harassed us so badly that instead of Alberto staying, both of us decided to leave for Venezuela as soon as possible. So by the time you get this letter, I’l  be just about ready to leave. If you want to chance it, write to Cucuta, Santander del Norte, Colombia, or very quickly here to Bogotá. Tomorrow I’m off to see Mil onarios play Real Madrid in the cheapest stand, since our compatriots are harder to tap than ministers. There is more repression of individual freedom  here  than  in  any  country  we’ve  been  to,  the  police  patrol  the  streets  carrying  rifles  and demand your papers every few minutes, which some of them read upside down. The atmosphere is tense and it seems a revolution may be brewing. The countryside is in open revolt and the army is powerless to suppress it. The conservatives battle among themselves and cannot agree, and the memory  of April  9,  1948,*  stil   weighs  heavily  on  everyone’s  minds.  In  summary,  it’s  suffocating here. If the Colombians want to put up with it, good luck to them, but we’re getting out of here as soon as we can. Apparently Alberto has a good chance of finding work in Caracas.  \\n I real y hope someone wil  scribble a few lines to let me know how you are. You won’t have to glean  information  through  Beatríz  or  some  other  intermediary  this  time  (I’m  not  replying  to  her because we’re limiting ourselves to one letter per city, which is why the card for Alfredito Gabela is enclosed).  \\n A huge hug from your son, who misses you from head to toe. I hope the old man manages to get himself to Venezuela, the cost of living is more than here, but the pay is much better and that should suit a skinflint (!) like him. By the way, if after living up here for a while he’s stil  in love with Uncle Sam… but let’s not get distracted, Papi can read between the lines.   Chau .  \\n \\n \\n *Argentine footballer.  \\n **Argentine footballer.  \\n *When the radical Liberal politician Jorge Eliécer Gaitán was murdered.  \\n HACIA CARACAS \\n on the road to caracas \\n \\n After  the  inevitable  and  unnecessary  questions,  the  manhandling  and  fiddling  around  with  our passports, and the inquisitorial stares, so suspicious as to be worthy of a police officer, the official stamped  our  passports  with  a  big  departure  date  of  July  14,  and  we  set  out  on  foot  across  the bridge uniting and dividing the two countries. A Venezuelan soldier, with the same spiteful insolence as his Colombian counterparts — a common trait among al  military stock, it seems — checked our luggage and then seized the opportunity to submit us to his own personal interrogation, just to show we were talking to someone with “authority.” They detained us for a good while in San Antonio de Táchira  but  only  for  administrative  formalities,  and  then  we  continued  our  journey  in  a  van  which promised to take us to the city of San Cristóbal. Halfway along the road is the customs post where we endured a thorough search of our entire luggage and our persons. The famous knife which had caused so much trouble in Bogotá returned, as the leit motif of a long discussion with the police chief. We conducted this discussion with an ease mastered through dealings with people of such high  culture.  The  revolver  was  saved  because  it  was  inside  the  pocket  of  my  leather  jacket,  in  a bundle whose stench scared off the customs officers. The knife, recovered with much effort, was a new cause for concern because customs posts were placed al  the way to Caracas and we weren’t certain of being able to find brains capable of processing the elementary reasons we gave them.  \\n The road linking the two frontier townships is paved perfectly, especial y on the Venezuelan side, and reminds me of the mountainous regions around Córdoba. In general, it seems that this country is more prosperous than Colombia.  \\n On arriving in San Cristóbal, a fight broke out between the owners of the transport company and ourselves, who wanted to travel in the most economic way possible. For the first time in our trip,  \\n “their” thesis regarding the advantages of two days’ traveling by van, rather than taking three days in a bus, won out. Eager to resolve our immediate futures and find proper treatment for my asthma, we decided  to  part  with  an  extra  20   bolívares ,  sacrificing  them  in  honor  of  Caracas.  We  occupied ourselves until evening, wandering around the neighborhood and reading a little about the country in \\n \\n quite a good library that’s there.  \\n At 11 p.m. we set off northward, leaving behind us al  traces of asphalt. In a seat where three people were already squeezed in, they crammed in four of us, so there was no chance of sleeping.  \\n Even  worse,  a  flat  tire  lost  us  an  hour  and  my  asthma  was  stil   bothering  me.  Wearily  climbing toward the summit, the vegetation became scarcer, although in the val eys you could see the same types of crops growing as in Colombia. The roads were in a terrible state, causing many punctures; on our second day on the road we had several. The police have control points thoroughly checking al   vans  and  we  would  have  found  ourselves  in  dire  straits  without  the  help  of  the  letter  of recommendation  one  woman  passenger  had  —  the  driver  claimed  al   the  luggage  was  hers, mission accomplished. The price of a meal had risen and one   bolívar  per head became more like three and a half. We decided to save as much money as we could, so we fasted at the stop in Punta del Águila, but the driver took pity on our indigence and gave us a good meal, at his expense. Punta del Águila is the highest point of the Venezuelan Andes, reaching 4,108 meters above sea level. I took my two last remaining tablets with which I was able to get through the night. At dawn, the driver stopped for an hour to sleep. He had been driving for two days without a break. We expected to arrive in Caracas that night but flat tires delayed us again, as wel  as faulty wiring which meant the battery couldn’t charge and we had to stop to fix it. The climate had become tropical and there were aggressive mosquitoes and bananas on al  sides. The last stretch, during which I dozed, trying to cope with a decent asthma attack, was asphalted properly and seemed to be quite pretty (it was dark by then). As we arrived at our destination the sky was lightening. I was absolutely wrecked. I fel into  a  bed  we  rented  for  half  a   bolívar   and  slept  like  a  tiger,  aided  by  the  substantial  adrenalin injection given to me by Alberto.  \\n ESTE EXTRAÑO SIGLO VEINTE \\n his strange twentieth century \\n \\n The worst of my asthma attack has now passed and I feel almost wel , though sometimes I resort to my new acquisition, a French inhaler. I feel Alberto’s absence so sharply. It seems like my flanks are unguarded  from  some  hypothetical  attack. At  every  other  moment  I’m  turning  around  to  share  an observation with him only to realize he’s not there.  \\n It’s true, there’s not real y much to complain about: thoroughly looked after, good food and a lot of  it,  and  the  anticipation  of  returning  home  to  start  studying  again  and  to  complete  the  degree \\n which wil  enable me to practise. Yet the idea of splitting up definitively doesn’t make me completely happy; the many months we’ve been side by side, through good and bad, accustomed to dreaming similar  dreams  in  similar  situations,  have  brought  us  so  much  closer  together.  With  these  ideas constantly turning over in my mind, I find myself drifting away from the center of Caracas. The homes in the suburbs are spaced much further apart. Caracas extends along the length of a narrow val ey, enclosing and restraining it on its edges, so that on a short walk you’l  be climbing the surrounding hil s, and there, with the progressive city laid out before your feet, you’l  begin to see a new aspect of its  multifaceted  makeup.  The  blacks,  those  magnificent  examples  of  the African  race  who  have maintained their racial purity thanks to their lack of an affinity with bathing, have seen their territory invaded by a new kind of slave: the Portuguese. And the two ancient races have now begun a hard life  together,  fraught  with  bickering  and  squabbles.  Discrimination  and  poverty  unite  them  in  the daily  fight  for  survival  but  their  different  ways  of  approaching  life  separate  them  completely:  the black is indolent and a dreamer; spending his meager wage on frivolity or drink; the European has a tradition of work and saving, which has pursued him as far as this corner of America and drives him to advance himself, even independently of his own individual aspirations.  \\n At  this  elevation  the  concrete  houses  have  total y  disappeared  and  only  adobe  huts  reign.  I peer into one of them. It is a room half separated by a partition, with a fireplace and table and a heap of straw on the ground, apparently serving as beds. Various bony cats and a mangy dog play with  three  completely  naked  black  children.  Rising  from  the  fire,  acrid  smoke  fil s  the  room.  The black  mother,  frizzy  hair  and  sagging  breasts,  is  cooking,  assisted  by  a  girl  of  about  15,  who  is dressed. At the door of the hut we get into a conversation and after a while I ask if they wil  pose for a photo, which they categorical y refuse to do unless I give it to them straight away. In vain I try to explain that I have to develop it first, but no, they want it then and there, or no bal  game. Eventual y I promise  to  hand  it  over  straight  away,  but  now  they  are  suspicious  and  don’t  want  to  cooperate.  \\n One of the kids escapes to play with his friends while I continue chatting with the family. In the end, I stand guard at the door, camera in hand, pretending to snap anyone who pokes out their head. We play around like this for a while until I see the little kid returning carefree on a new bicycle; I focus and press the button but the effect is disastrous. To elude the photo, the kid swerves and fal s to the ground, bursting into tears. Immediately they al  lose their fear of the camera and rush out to hurl abuse  at  me.  I  withdraw  somewhat  apprehensively  because  they  are  excel ent  stone  throwers, fol owed by the insults of the group — including the height of contempt: “Portuguese.”  \\n Littered  along  the  edges  of  the  road  are  containers  for  transporting  cars,  used  by  the Portuguese as dwel ings. In one of these, where a black family lives, I can just glimpse a brand new refrigerator, and from many of them radios blare music which their owners play at maximum volume.  \\n New  cars  are  parked  outside  the  most  miserable  “homes.” Al   kinds  of  aircraft  pass  overhead, sowing the air with noise and silver reflections and there, at my feet, lies Caracas, city of the eternal spring. Its center is threatened by the invasion of red tiled roofs that converge with the flat roofs of modern buildings. But something else wil  al ow the yel owy color of its colonial buildings to live on,  \\n \\n even  after  they  have  disappeared  from  the  city  maps:  the  spirit  of  Caracas,  impervious  to  the lifestyle of the North and stubbornly rooted in the retrograde semi-pastoral conditions of its colonial past.  \\n ACOTACIÓN AL MARGEN \\n a note in the margin \\n \\n The stars drew light across the night sky in that little mountain vil age, and the silence and the cold made the darkness vanish away. It was — I don’t know how to explain it — as if everything solid melted  away  into  the  ether,  eliminating  al   individuality  and  absorbing  us,  rigid,  into  the  immense darkness. Not a single cloud to lend perspective to the space blocked any portion of the starry sky.  \\n Less than a few meters away the dim light of a lamp lost its power to fade the darkness.  \\n The man’s face was indistinct in the shadows; I could only see what seemed like the spark of his eyes and the gleam of his four front teeth.  \\n I stil  can’t say whether it was the atmosphere or the personality of that individual that prepared me for the revelation, but I know that many times and from many different people I had heard those same arguments and that they had never made an impression on me. Our interlocutor was, in fact, a very  interesting  character.  From  a  country  in  Europe,  he  escaped  the  knife  of  dogmatism  as  a young man, he knew the taste of fear (one of the few experiences which makes you value life), and afterwards  he  had  wandered  from  country  to  country,  gathering  thousands  of  adventures,  until  he and  his  bones  final y  ended  up  in  this  isolated  region,  patiently  waiting  for  the  moment  of  great reckoning to arrive.  \\n After  exchanging  a  few  meaningless  words  and  platitudes,  each  of  us  marking  territory,  the discussion  began  to  falter  and  we  were  about  to  go  our  separate  ways,  when  he  let  out  his idiosyncratic, childlike laugh, highlighting the asymmetry of his four front incisors: The future belongs to the people, and gradually, or in one strike, they will take power, here and in every country.  \\n The terrible thing is the people need to be educated, and this they cannot do before taking power, only after. They can only learn at the cost of their own mistakes, which will be very serious and will cost many innocent lives. Or perhaps not, maybe those lives will not have been innocent because they will have committed the huge sin against nature; meaning, a lack of ability to adapt. All of them, those unable to adapt — you and I, for example — will die cursing the power they helped, through great sacrifice, to create. Revolution is impersonal; it will take their lives, even utilizing their \\n memory as an example or as an instrument for domesticating the youth who follow them. My sin is greater because I, more astute and with greater experience, call it what you like, will die knowing that my sacrifice stems only from an inflexibility symbolizing our rotten civilization, which is crumbling. I also know — and this won’t alter the course of history or your personal view of me — that you will die with a clenched fist and a tense jaw, the epitome of hatred and struggle, because you are not a symbol (some inanimate example) but a genuine member of the society to be destroyed; the spirit of the beehive speaks through your mouth and motivates your actions. You are as useful as I am, but you are not aware of how useful your contribution is to the society that sacrifices you.  \\n \\n I saw his teeth and the cheeky grin with which he foretold history, I felt his handshake and, like a distant  murmur,  his  formal  goodbye.  The  night,  folding  in  at  contact  with  his  words,  overtook  me again,  enveloping  me  within  it.  But  despite  his  words,  I  now  knew…  I  knew  that  when  the  great guiding spirit cleaves humanity into two antagonistic halves, I would be with the people. I know this, I see it printed in the night sky that I, eclectic dissembler of doctrine and psychoanalyst of dogma, howling like one possessed, wil  assault the barricades or the trenches, wil  take my bloodstained weapon and, consumed with fury, slaughter any enemy who fal s into my hands. And I see, as if a great exhaustion smothers this fresh exaltation, I see myself, immolated in the genuine revolution, the  great  equalizer  of  individual  wil ,  proclaiming  the  ultimate   mea culpa .  I  feel  my  nostrils  dilate, savoring the acrid smel  of gunpowder and blood, the enemy’s death; I steel my body, ready to do battle,  and  prepare  myself  to  be  a  sacred  space  within  which  the  bestial  howl  of  the  triumphant proletariat can resound with new energy and new hope.  \\n APPENDIX: SPEECH TO MEDICAL STUDENTS \\n a child of my environment \\n August 20, 1960 \\n \\n Eight  years  after  writing   The  Motorcycle  Diaries ,  Ernesto  Che  Guevara  had  become  a  central figure in Cuba’s revolutionary government. After his journey with Alberto Granado, he had traveled again  through  Latin  America,  experienced  the  CIA-backed  coup  in  Guatemala  and  joined  the Cuban revolutionary movement that eventual y took power in 1959. In this speech to Cuban medical students  and  workers,  Che  reflects  on  his  own  development  from  medical  student  to  political activist.  \\n Almost everyone knows that I started my career as a doctor a number of years ago. When I started out  as  a  doctor,  when  I  began  to  study  medicine,  the  majority  of  the  concepts  I  hold  today  as  a revolutionary were absent from the storehouse of my ideals.  \\n I  wanted  to  succeed,  as  everybody  wants  to  succeed.  I  dreamed  about  being  a  famous researcher.  I  dreamed  of  working  tirelessly  to  achieve  something  that  could  real y  be  put  at  the disposal of humanity, but that, at the same time, would be a personal triumph. I was, as we al  are, a child of my environment.  \\n Through special circumstances, and perhaps also because of my character, after receiving my degree I began to travel through Latin America and I came to know it intimately. Except for Haiti and the Dominican Republic, I have visited — in one way or another — al  the other countries of Latin America. In the way I traveled, first as a student and afterward as a doctor, I began to come into close contact with poverty, with hunger, with disease, with the inability to cure a child because of a lack of resources, with the numbness that hunger and continued punishment cause until a point is reached where a parent losing a child is an unimportant incident, as often happens among the hard-hit classes of our Latin American homeland. And I began to see there was something that, at that time, seemed to me almost as important as being a famous researcher or making some substantial contribution to medical science, and this was helping those people.  \\n But  I  continued  being,  as  al   of  us  always  continue  being,  a  child  of  my  environment,  and  I wanted to help those people through my personal efforts. I had already traveled a lot — I was then in Guatemala, the Guatemala of [democratical y elected Jacobo] Árbenz — and I had begun to make some notes to guide the conduct of a revolutionary doctor. I began to look into what I needed to be a revolutionary doctor.  \\n The attack came, however: the [1954] coup unleashed by the United Fruit Company, the U.S.  \\n State Department, [CIA director] Foster Dul es — in reality, they are al  the same thing — and the puppet [they replaced Árbenz with], Castil o Ármas. The aggression was successful, given that the people had not yet reached the level of maturity the Cuban people have today. And one fine day, I,  \\n like so many others, took the road to exile, or at least I took the road of fleeing from Guatemala, since that was not my homeland.  \\n Then  I  realized  one  fundamental  thing:  to  be  a  revolutionary  doctor,  or  to  be  a  revolutionary, there  must  first  be  a  revolution.  The  isolated  effort,  the  individual  effort,  the  purity  of  ideals,  the desire  to  sacrifice  an  entire  lifetime  to  the  noblest  of  ideals  means  naught  if  that  effort  is  made alone,  solitary,  in  some  corner  of  Latin America,  fighting  against  hostile  governments  and  social conditions that do not permit progress. A revolution needs what we have in Cuba: an entire people mobilized, who have learned the use of arms and the practise of combative unity, who know what a weapon is worth and what the people’s unity is worth.  \\n Then we get to the heart of the problem that today lies ahead of us. We already have the right and even the obligation to be, before anything else, a revolutionary doctor, that is, a person who puts the technical knowledge of his profession at the service of the revolution and of the people.  \\n Then we come back to the earlier questions: How does one work for social welfare effectively? How does one reconcile individual effort with the needs of society?  \\n We again have to recal  what each of our lives was like, what each of us did and thought, as a doctor or in any other public health function, prior to the revolution. We have to do so with profound critical  enthusiasm.  We  wil   then  conclude  that  almost  everything  we  thought  and  felt  in  that  past epoch should be filed away, and that a new type of human being should be created. If each one of us is their own architect of that new type of human being, then creating that new type of human being \\n — who wil  represent the new Cuba — wil  be much easier.  \\n It is good for you — those present, the residents of Havana — to absorb this idea: that in Cuba a new type of human being is being created, which cannot be entirely appreciated in the capital, but which can be seen in every other corner of the country. Those of you who went to the Sierra Maestra on July 26 must have seen something very important… You must have seen children who by their physical stature appear eight or nine years old, but who nevertheless are almost al  13 or 14. They are the genuine children of the Sierra Maestra, the genuine children of hunger and poverty in al  its forms. They are the creatures of malnutrition.  \\n In this smal  Cuba, with four or five television channels, with hundreds of radio stations, with al the advances of modern science, when one night those children arrived at school and for the first time saw electric light, they exclaimed that the stars were very low that night. Those children, whom some of you would have seen, are now learning in the col ective schools, from the ABCs right up to learning a trade, right up to the very difficult science of being revolutionaries.  \\n These  are  the  new  kinds  of  human  beings  born  in  Cuba.  They  are  being  born  in  isolated places, in remote parts of the Sierra Maestra and also in the cooperatives and workplaces.  \\n Al  that has a lot to do with the topic of our talk today: the integration of the doctor and other medical  workers  into  the  revolutionary  movement.  Because  the  revolution’s  task  —  the  task  of \\n training and nourishing the children, the task of educating the army, the task of distributing the lands of  the  old  absentee  landlords  among  those  who  sweated  every  day  on  that  same  land  without reaping its fruit — is the greatest work of social medicine that has been done in Cuba.  \\n The battle against disease should be based on the principle of creating a robust body — not through a doctor’s artistic work on a weak organism — but creating a robust body through the work of the whole col ectivity, especial y the whole social col ectivity.  \\n One day medicine wil  have to become a science that serves to prevent diseases, to orient the entire public toward their medical obligations, and which only has to intervene in cases of extreme urgency to perform some surgical operation or to deal with something unusual in that new society we  are  creating…  For  that  organizational  task,  as  for  al   revolutionary  tasks,  what  is  required, fundamental y, is the individual. The revolution is not, as some claim, a standardizer of col ective wil , of col ective initiative. To the contrary, it is a liberator of human beings’ individual capacity.  \\n What the revolution does do, however, is to direct that capacity. Our task today is to orient the creative talent of al  the medical professionals toward the tasks of social medicine.  \\n We are at the end of an era, and not only here in Cuba. Despite al  that is said to the contrary and despite al  the hopes of some people, the forms of capitalism we have known, under which we have been raised and have suffered, are being defeated throughout the world. The monopolies are being defeated. Col ective science every day registers new and important triumphs. And we have had  the  pride  and  the  self-sacrificing  duty  of  being  the  vanguard  in  Latin America  of  a  liberation movement that began some time ago, in the other subjugated continents of Africa and Asia. That very profound social change also demands very profound changes in the mentality of the people.  \\n Individualism as such, as the isolated action of a person alone in a social environment, must disappear in Cuba. Individualism tomorrow should be the proper utilization of the whole individual, to  the  absolute  benefit  of  the  community.  But  even  when  al   this  is  understood  today,  even  when these things I am saying are comprehended, and even when everyone is wil ing to think a little about the present, about the past, and about what the future should be, changing the manner of thinking requires  profound  internal  changes  and  helping  bring  about  profound  external  changes,  primarily social.  \\n Those external changes are taking place in Cuba every day. One way of learning about this revolution, of getting to know the forces the people keep stored inside themselves, forces that have been dormant for so long, is to visit al  of Cuba, visit the cooperatives and al  the workplaces being created. And one way of getting to the heart of the medical question is not only knowing, not only visiting  these  places,  but  also  getting  to  know  the  people  who  make  up  those  cooperatives  and work centers. Go there and find out what diseases they have, what their ailments are, what extreme poverty  they  have  experienced  over  the  years,  inherited  from  centuries  of  repression  and  total submission. The doctor, the medical worker, should then go to the heart of their new work, which is as a person among the masses, a person within the community.  \\n Whatever  happens  in  the  world,  by  always  being  close  to  the  patient,  by  knowing  his  or  her psychology so deeply, by being the representative of those who come near pain and relieve it, the doctor always has a very important job, a job of great responsibility in social life.  \\n Some time ago, a few months, it so happened here in Havana that a group of students, recently qualified  doctors,  did  not  want  to  go  to  the  countryside  and  were  demanding  extra  payment  for going. From the viewpoint of the past it is more than logical that this would occur; at least it seems that way to me, and I understand it. I remember that this was the way it was, the way it was thought about some years ago. Once more it is the gladiator in rebel ion, the solitary fighter who wants to ensure a better future, better conditions, and to achieve recognition for what he or she does.  \\n But what would happen if it were not those individuals — the majority of whose families could pay  for  their  several  years  of  study  —  who  completed  their  courses  and  are  now  beginning  to practise their profession? What if instead it was 200 or 300 peasants who had emerged, let’s say by magic, from the university lecture hal s?  \\n What would have happened, simply, is that those peasants would have run immediately, and with great enthusiasm, to attend to their brothers and sisters. They would have requested the posts with the most responsibility and the most work, in order to show that the years of study given them were not in vain. What would have happened is what wil  happen within six or seven years, when the new students, children of the working class and the peasantry, receive their professional degrees of whatever type.  \\n But  we  should  not  view  the  future  with  fatalism  and  divide  human  beings  into  children  of  the working class or peasantry, and counterrevolutionaries. That is simplistic, it is not true, and there is nothing that educates an honorable person more than living within a revolution.  \\n None of us, none of the first group that arrived in the   Granma , who established ourselves in the Sierra Maestra, and who learned to respect the peasant and the worker, living together with them — \\n none of us had a past as a worker or peasant. Natural y, there were those who had to work, who had known  certain  wants  in  their  childhood.  But  hunger,  true  hunger,  none  of  us  had  known,  and  we began to know it, temporarily, during the two long years in the Sierra Maestra. And then many things became very clear… we learned perfectly that the life of a single human being is worth mil ions of times more than al  the property of the richest man on earth. We learned it there, we who were not children of the working class or the peasantry. So why should we now shout to the four winds that we are the privileged ones and that the rest of the Cuban people cannot learn, too? Yes, they can learn.  \\n In  fact,  the  revolution  today  demands  that  they  learn,  demands  that  they  understand  wel   that  the pride  of  serving  our  fel ow  man  is  much  more  important  than  a  good  income;  that  the  people’s gratitude is much more permanent, much more lasting than al  the gold one can accumulate. Each doctor, in the sphere of their activity, can and should accumulate that prized treasure, the people’s gratitude.  \\n We must then begin to erase our old concepts and come ever closer and ever more critical y to \\n the people. Not in the way we got closer before, because al  of you wil  say: “No, I am a friend of the people. I enjoy talking with workers and peasants, and on Sundays I go to such and such a place to see such and such a thing.” Everybody has done that. But they have done it practising charity, and what we have to practise today is solidarity. We should not draw closer to the people to say: “Here we  are.  We  come  to  give  you  the  charity  of  our  presence,  to  teach  you  with  our  science,  to demonstrate your errors, your lack of refinement, your lack of elementary knowledge.” We should go with an investigative zeal and with a humble spirit, to learn from the great source of wisdom that is the people.  \\n Often we realize how mistaken we were in concepts we knew so wel ; they had become part of us and, automatical y, of our consciousness. Every so often we ought to change al  our concepts, not just general, social or philosophical concepts, but also, at times, our medical concepts. We wil  see that diseases are not always treated as one treats il ness in a big-city hospital. We wil  see then that the doctor also has to be a farmer, that he or she has to learn to cultivate new foods and, by his or her example, to cultivate the desire to consume new foods, to diversify the food structure in Cuba — \\n so smal  and so poor in an agricultural country that is potential y the richest on earth. We wil  then see that under such circumstances we wil  have to be quite pedagogic, at times very pedagogic, that we wil  also have to be politicians; that the first thing we wil  have to do is not go offering our wisdom, but showing that we are ready to learn with the people, to carry out that great and beautiful common experience — to build a new Cuba.  \\n We  have  already  taken  many  steps,  and  the  distance  between  January  1,  1959,  and  today cannot be measured in a conventional manner. Some time ago the people understood that not only had a dictator fal en here, but a system had fal en as wel . Now the people should learn that upon the ruins  of  a  crumbled  system,  one  must  build  a  new  one  that  brings  about  the  people’s  absolute happiness.  \\n …We have definitively become convinced that there is a common enemy. We know that everyone looks  over  their  shoulders  to  see  if  someone  wil   hear  them,  if  someone  is  listening  from  some embassy  who  wil   transmit  what  they  hear,  before  they  clearly  state  their  opinion  against  the monopolies,  before  saying  clearly:  “Our  enemy,  and  the  enemy  of  al   Latin  America,  is  the monopolistic government of the United States of America.”  \\n If  everybody  already  knows  that  this  is  the  enemy,  and  if  our  starting  point  is  knowing  that whoever struggles against that enemy has something in common with us, then comes the second part. What are our goals here in Cuba? What do we want? Do we want the people’s happiness or not?  Are  we  struggling  for  Cuba’s  absolute  economic  liberation  or  not?  Are  we  or  are  we  not struggling to be a free country among free countries, without belonging to any military bloc, without having to consult any embassy of any great power on earth about any domestic or foreign decision we make? Are we thinking of redistributing the wealth of those who have too much, to give to those who have nothing? Are we thinking here of doing creative work, a dynamic daily source of al  our \\n happiness? If so, then we already have the goals to which we referred… At times of great danger, at times of great tension and great creation, what counts are the great enemy and the great goals. If we agree, if we al  already know where we are going, then whatever happens, we must begin our work.  \\n I was tel ing you that to be a revolutionary requires having a revolution. We already have it. And a revolutionary must also know the people with whom he or she is to work. I think we stil  don’t know one another wel . I think we stil  have to travel a while along that road… [Yet] if we know the goals, if we know the enemy, and if we know the direction in which we have to travel, then the only thing left for us is to know the daily stretch of the road and to take it. Nobody can point out that stretch; that stretch is the personal road of each individual; it is what he or she wil  do every day, what he or she wil  gain from their individual experience, and what he or she wil  give of themselves in practising their profession, dedicated to the people’s wel -being.  \\n If we already possess al  the elements with which to march toward the future, let us then recal that phrase of José Martí, which at this moment I am not putting into practise, but which we must constantly put into practise: “The best form of saying is doing.” And let us then march toward the future of Cuba.  \\n The full text of this speech is printed in the expanded edition of   Che Guevara Reader , published by Ocean Press in 2003.  \\n BOOKS FROM OCEAN PRESS \\n \\n CUBA BY KORDA \\n   Alberto Korda \\n The first publication of the work of the Cuban photographer celebrated for his iconic photograph of Che Guevara.
