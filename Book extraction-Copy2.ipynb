It's going to test the caravan's every step to see if it's in time, and, if it is, we will make it to the oasis.” </br> “If either of us had joined this caravan based only on personal courage, but without understanding that language, this journey would have been much more difficult.” </br> They stood there looking at the moon. </br> “That's the magic of omens,” said the boy. “I've seen how the guides read the signs of the desert, and how the soul of the caravan speaks to the soul of the desert.” </br> The Englishman said, “I'd better pay more attention to the caravan.” </br> “And I'd better read your books,” said the boy. </br> * </br> They were strange books.

I want to be like you, able to reach every corner of the world, cross the seas, blow away the sands that cover my treasure, and carry the voice of the woman I love.” </br> “I heard what you were talking about the other day with the alchemist,” the wind said. “He said that everything has its own destiny. But people can't turn themselves into the wind.” </br> “Just teach me to be the wind for a few moments,” the boy said. “So you and I can talk about the limitless possibilities of people and the winds.” </br> The wind's curiosity was aroused, something that had never happened before. It wanted to talk about those things, but it didn't know how to turn a man into the wind. And look how many things the wind already knew how to do! It created deserts, sank ships, felled entire forests, and blew through cities filled with music and strange noises. It felt that it had no limits, yet here was a boy saying that there were other things the wind should be able to do. </br> “This is what we call love,” the boy said, seeing that the wind was close to granting what he requested. “When you are loved, you can do anything in creation. When you are loved, there's no need at all to understand what's happening, because everything happens within you, and even men can turn themselves into the wind. As long as the wind helps, of course.” </br> The wind was a proud being, and it was becoming irritated with what the boy was saying. It commenced to blow harder, raising the desert sands. But finally it had to recognize that, even making its way around the world, it didn't know how to turn a man into the wind. And it knew nothing about love. </br> “In my travels around the world, I've often seen people speaking of love and looking toward the heavens,” the wind said, furious at having to acknowledge its own limitations. “Maybe it's better to ask heaven.” </br> “Well then, help me do that,” the boy said. “Fill this place with a sandstorm so strong that it blots out the sun. Then I can look to heaven without blinding myself.” </br> So the wind blew with all its strength, and the sky was filled with sand. The sun was turned into a golden disk. </br> At the camp, it was difficult to see anything. The men of the desert were already familiar with that wind. They called it the simum, and it was worse than a storm at sea. Their horses cried out, and all their weapons were filled with sand. </br> On the heights, one of the commanders turned to the chief and said, “Maybe we had better end this!” </br> They could barely see the boy. Their faces were covered with the blue cloths, and their eyes showed fear. </br> “Let's stop this,” another commander said. </br> “I want to see the greatness of Allah,” the chief said, with respect. “I want to see how a man turns himself into the wind.” </br> But he made a mental note of the names of the \n",
